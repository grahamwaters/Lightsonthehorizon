# Lights on the Horizon: A Data Science Approach to UFO Sightings
Valence Density, text variability, and ML applied to Anomaly detection in NUFORC and MUFON reports.

## Introduction


*  Preprocessing:
** Load and clean the UFO report data
** Convert relevant columns to appropriate data types (e.g. datetime, float)
Extract additional features from the data (e.g. duration, time since event)
Handle missing or invalid values
Add geographic information (e.g. latitude, longitude, elevation)
Exploration:
Visualize the data to understand the distribution and relationships of the features
Identify any potential outliers or anomalies
Feature engineering:
Select relevant features for modeling
Normalize or standardize the features if necessary
Modeling:
Select appropriate unsupervised learning algorithm (e.g. DBSCAN)
Train and tune the model using cross-validation
Evaluate the model performance using appropriate metrics
Interpretation:
Interpret the results of the model
Identify commonalities within certain geographic valences around each report
Explore the relationships between the features and the report quality
Provide insights and recommendations based on the findings
