MUFON,2010-08-14 9:15PM,3/13/21,,Bogalusa,LA ,LOUISIANA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Driving home at dark we’re on a new road that boarded Ft Knox KY. Three huge brights started descending towards us. I thought it was an airplane though all we could see were these blinding lights. I said that I thought it was going to land on us. Then it was stationary over the road. Two more light turned on on either side of the three. Then as in one second they simultaneously darted down to the side I’d the road and all lights and evidence of it was gone. In the daytime I looked at spot where they went down and it was a depression of weeds and tree saplings. It bordered on Ft Know property line. It wasn’t until years later I realized there was no sound. In fact I felt numb after seeing it. Content-type: text/html,,it was a bright blue light flying over head,blinding,,"Bogalusa,LA "

MUFON,2020-07-26 7:25PM,3/6/21,,Hillsboro,TN ,TENNESSEE,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was driving on 285 South at 845 PM on my way back from work when I rounded a corner headed into Conifer by Meyers Ranch Park. I noticed a bright light like a train headlight moving over the tree line. It was extremely bright and almost blinding. On the right edge of the triangle there was a solid red light. On the left edge of the triangle there was a solid blue light. The object moved straight towards the highway at approximately 50 feet above the tree line and did not change altitude. I turned the radio down and rolled the window down to see if if I could hear prop wash from a helicopter but there wasnt any sound coming from it. Then before it reached the highway it made a 45 degree turn on a dime and headed north down 285. After seeing the object I felt extremely tired.

MUFON,1996-02-20 6:00PM,2/27/21,,Elizabethtown,KY ,KENTUCKY,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report My husband and I saw a red orb in the sky. It followed the same PATH both times---The orb PATH looked like an upside down triangle. When it got to the tip (which was the bottom) it stopped for a second but it wasn't red anymore. It was sort of white and glowing with rays coming from it (blinding bright enough that it made me squint my eyes like looking at the sun or somebody shining a bright flashlight in your eyes ) and huge. It covered the whole sky. I said awesome! Then it followed the same PATH it took before and was over in around 1 minute. This was on July 31 2017 between 10:00 P.M.-10:30 P.M. in Rockford Ohio. This was also on the news. There were 5 people (including myself my husband and a friend. I know more people had to have seen this. My sister saw it on the news but she forgot what they said it was. I emailed the TV stations around but nobody bothered answering me. My daughter and her friend were outside across town and saw the same thing. Have you heard of anything like this? Sincerely [link moved to Investigators report section/ CMS/fgc] PS. I was on another site this year a woman talked about this brilliant light coming through her window. I answered her and told her my story. She was shocked and asked me how I knew so I told her my story. She was from CA and her sighting was 2020. I’m trying to find her again.

MUFON,2021-02-22 8:45PM,2/23/21,,Conifer,CO ,COLORADO,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report My wife and I were driving east on route 22 outside Harrisburg right before the Hershey exit and saw a blinding blueish white circular orb shoot across the sky in front of us about 500 to 600 feet up in sky. It was blinding through the clouds. It only lasted about 5 seconds to 8 seconds maybe less. It flew the entire width of the sky and disappeared without a sound or flash or anything. We thought it was a meteorite at first but there was no burning trail behind it and with how big it would have been no explosion from impact. At a disgrace of about 500 feet the object was about the size of a basketball so about 7 degrees coverage making it about 73 to 80 feet across. It covered the distance of the visible sky in under 8 seconds with sharp angle change before completely disappearing.

MUFON,2017-07-31 10:10PM,1/7/21,,Rockford,OH ,OHIO,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was coming back from Jacksonville Florida to Callahan Florida on or about June of 1951 (I remembered this encounter in 1970). I was driving alone along a deserted Hwy US 1 near Densmore Florida roughly 6 miles from Callahan. I was alone and there were no other vehicles in the area. I was driving a 1934 Ford Coupe with a small high window in the back. As I was driving I suddenly noticed a very bright light at a distance behind me maybe a mile. I thought it was a truck. The second time I looked whatever it was had moved directly over me. Then I felt a tingling sensation and the hair on the back of my neck rose. In my 86 years I never had this feeling happen. I slowed the vehicle down then sped up several times. Whatever it was stayed over me the entire time. While this was going on the light from the object was similar to lightning strikes because it cast no shadows. It was almost blinding. I then decided to pull over to see what it was (I was very scared). I stopped opened the door and as soon as I stepped out the light vanished. I never heard any sound at all. I don't think it was a plane or helicopter because there was no noise or wind. The tingling sensation left when the light left. I knew there was something there but there was no trace. It left a strange feeling. I didn't tell anyone about it for fear of ridicule. I'm 86 now and still remember it like it was yesterday. It's not something you forget and I wanted people to know.

MUFON,2020-12-08 7:30PM,12/8/20,,Marion,VA ,VIRGINIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Time of UFO sighting: Early afternoon mid-summer about 22 years ago. Total duration of sighting was about 8 seconds. Sky conditions: Sunny hazy pale blue with no noticeable cloud formations beyond the two small semi-transparent clouds described and shown in my drawing. My situation: I was driving and stopped at a stop sign in a huge parking lot at that time. My view of the sky was unobstructed in the mid sky. I witnessed this sighting while my passenger only witnessed the sudden flash of white light. UFO type: This UFO sighting had consisted of three different shapes as follows: Shape 1. Two very similar small semi-transparent white clouds positioned fairly close to each other within the mid-sky. These two clouds did not move nor change in appearance during this entire sighting. Shape 2. One very straight and narrow luminous elongating band of gold-yellow light. This narrow band of light had emerged out of one cloud to have then quickly entered into the another cloud where it then quickly disappeared. Yet nothing was ever observed within either of these thin semi-transparent clouds. Shape 3. An expanding luminous circular white light had begun to appear and expand at point B where it soon seemed to have momentarily engulfed my entire field of vision within a brief blinding white light. If I had not already been looking into the sky at the onset I might never have noticed anything unusual that day other than this very brief flash of brilliant white light. My passenger in the car then also commented that they too have witnessed this flash of white light. Immediately following this sudden flash of blinding white light I saw this same UFO band quickly move into the other nearby cloud where it then shortened in its length until it had vanished. In essence this entire sighting had seemed to 'mirror' itself. Meaning that if I were to divide this event in half that the first half of this event would have 'mirrored' the seconds half with the division point being the brief flash of blinding white light experienced by the witnesses. This being said there was a brief gap in my visual awareness as indicated in my drawing. Other than this brief gap everything else seemed to 'mirror.' Within my drawing I am trying to illustrate this elongating band of light from a different perspective as if conceptualized from outside myself. So could this expanding light observed at point B actually have been only turning at a 90 degree angle towards me where it then continued to elongate to suddenly engulf me within its momentary blindness of white light. In other words I'm thinking that there might not have been any break in this band's elongation at all but rather this band of light might have simply turned at point B to then simply pass directly through me on its way back towards the second cloud. I also suspect that these weren't real clouds as the UFO's luminous band of light seemed to immediately dissipate when entering either cloud. So if a person were to enter into this band of light might their physical body also dissipate within this light. This blinding white light might also suggest that a transformation had suddenly taken place although only very momentarily perceived. What I mean by this 'transformation' awareness is that could it be possible that this brief awareness of 'total blindness' might be evidence of a sudden break or disconnect from one's physical body. Anyway if I had not been looking up into the sky at that moment I likely wouldn't have noticed anything unusual that day beyond this very brief flash of white light. As for this band of light being able to turn at a 90 degree angle (see point B). This I have witnessed during a BT sighting. Content-type: text/html,,2 UFO’s.

MUFON,2020-10-10 8:25PM,10/10/20,,Harrisburg,PA ,PENNSYLVANIA,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report TO BE CLEAR. Only until i saw a report from someone named kramer that i actually felt like my experience was real. Throughout the years i have remembered fragments of ""memories"" that i excused as my imagination of being a soldier for the planet in outer space. My first memory was trying to go to sleep and when i felt that i was comfortable enough to go to sleep it felt like a light was turned on in my room but it wasn't coming from the door but from the wall. I'm not even sure i opened my eyes but i could feel the blinding light and two entities step into my room and i went with them. Within a few steps we were in a building about the size of a gymnasium and there were many other that i think were my age in the same area. I'm not actually sure that at any time while i was in the room were my eyes opened its like i could feel the room and the people in great detail and i didnt open my eyes until i breathe oxygen. There was a ship a massive base several destinations all explained by the witness kramer but i remember all my bones being broken my skin being alchemically rewritten a sense of familiarity with people that runs as deep as my family no memory of fear at anytime being at the precipice of the field and faces as diverse as the planet itself looking at me for direction. I cant prove any of this in any way but hearing his story compelled me to report this. Just think he should know that at least i and an indian woman i met once in california have shared the same experience Content-type: text/html",,Blinding light shot through sky then vanished,blinding,,"Harrisburg,PA "

His truck is over taken by a blinding white light snaps approximately 15 pictures with a being entering the picture a good front facing picture and another with alien being reaching into vehicle. Amazing photos!! Witness does not remember incident that occurred to years ago until deleting old photos and see these pictures and now memories are rushing back. Witness is afraid of alien return as well as public wishes to remain anonymous but wants MUFON to investigate the pictures and willing to tell story. He thinks he was abducted but doesn't want to talk about it. After pictures can be authenticated he said he is willing to talk more. Hand written account provided my witness attached. Besides pictures he has 2 videos and we took a video more of a recording of what he saw and went through and we drove the route he took that night and what he was seeing where but he wants to go one step at a time.

MUFON,1998-06-15 2:00PM,8/18/20,,Monaca,PA ,PENNSYLVANIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report On two separate instances one Friday June 12 2020 then again on June 14 2020 I observed a blinding white light in the sky that pulsated then emitted a downward beam of light then changed direction instantly shooting up into the atmosphere. Both events happened on clear sky nights first at Approximately 1am second at 2 am. The light started pulsating and stayed visible for approximately 10 seconds admitted a beam for approximately three seconds then shot straight into the atmosphere disappearing. I live about 45 minutes south of a small commercial airport. I have sat on my porch In the past at night and watched the airplanes takeoff with their landing lights on. I then watch as they turn their landing lights off and their strobe lights are then visible. The sighting was 50% brighter then any planes I have seen in the past Did not move in any flight path but remained hovering and disappeared completely without a trace. It seem to be at the same level as airplanes I have seen taking off in the past which would be approximately 10 000 feet. There was no sound like aircraft usually make and there were no other aircraft in the air during my sighting. I continue to watch the sky for approximately one hour after the sighting and nothing reappeared including aircraft.

MUFON,2020-07-30 12:00AM,7/30/20,,Phoenix,AZ ,ARIZONA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report On my backyard deck cooking supper at 5:30.... Noticed one small bright light moving slowly from the tree line in east. After focusing on it I then noticed a smaller bright red light at some distance away following parallel with the white light. Both lights moving constant but separately from one another with no vapor trail. (Both trading off front position) I thought the objects too high to effectively video with my phone so I opted for my binoculars. After trying all focusing methods on the binoculars I noticed the lights with total clarity. There was no structure connecting the two lights and no appendages. The white light was blindingly bright and the red one had a blinding white dot in the middle with a bright red hue around it. The lights were moving at a quick time pace from east to west. I had called my wife to come see but she was unable to see them. If I were to guess I would say they were between 4-6 miles high. I watched them util they were out of site in the western sky. My second sighting came about 3 minutes later when I observed one light moving very fast from south to north as I was looking west. Again the height was about 4-6 miles high with no vapor trail. My third sighting came about 10 minutes later. Looking where the first sighting came from I notice a bright light . Looking through the binoculars I noticed the object was a reflecting silver orb with a streaming silver tail like appendage moving like a kite tail but also seemed to move in the front sides top and back of the orb. (In a flailing motion) I called my wife out to see this as well...she was reluctant but she also did observe this sighting. Yay I'm not crazy!! LOL This object was much lower than the other two sightings. Maybe 2-3 miles high. We watched it until it disappeared into the southern tree line. I did contact FOX 25 Boston Facebook page to see if anyone else saw what I had seen. I will look into that later. Content-type: text/html,,20 Years of service to my planet,blinding,,"Phoenix,AZ "
MUFON,2018-00-00 12:00AM,6/17/20,,Windham Village/Township,OH ,OHIO,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report So this was over 20 years ago i believe it was mid to late 90's in upstate NY during the fall. it was late in the day probably 9 -10 PM. Pitch black out side and very quiet. me my two brothers and my friend rob were outside sitting on my dads old truck facing a mountain. The mountain was may be 1-2 miles away if that and between us and the mountain is a huge corn field. So were just out side talking and goofing around. and i remember this vividly. A massive white light around the size of a big house lit up the sky it was blinding white and made no sound what so ever. it slowly descended behind the mountain and it either crashed or landed but again it made no sound. and the white lights lit up the sky when it landed /crashed. well here is the weird thing it was like our minds were erased. i was the first person to remember what had happened. and i was like oh shit did you guys see that ( like there is no way they could have missed it ) and it was like they forgot too. the weird thing is i remember it being lighter out like it was almost 12pm when we went inside.

At first I thought it was a Cell Phone tower’s lights coming on but I know that there lights are red. Turned to watch the road and when I turned back they had gone and when the fog cleared I could see that there wasn’t a tower where the lights was. The white lights where bright but not blinding but it was clean white I cant really explain that kinda like brand new headlights ...the thing was just above the tree tops...the only way I could describe it would be if a truck with a motor bike in the bed was floating about the tree line with the truck and bike lights on..I saw this from a distance and it must have been larger than a RV..

MUFON,1999-06-01 9:00PM,6/4/20,,mount upton,NY ,NEW YORK,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was on route 12 traveling north from Utica NY and took the Rt. 8 ramp toward Poland and Speculator. While coming up the ramp I spotted very bright lights in the field to my left. My immediate thought was someone was out in the field with truck headlights jacking deer. I thought the lights were very bright for a truck but felt immediate anger for harming the deer. I traveled about another 500 feet when I saw a large flying craft bank to the right over the treetops and stop in midair in front of me and slightly above. I'm not sure how far out in front of me I couldn't tell how close it was because the lights were so bright angled directly at my car. I stopped the car in the middle of the road. I stared at it for maybe thirty seconds. I knew what it was immediately. I knew that they knew I had seen them in the field. I was frightened. I couldn't believe this was happening to me. The craft leveled out and without a sound it passed over my head about...maybe twenty feet above me. My face was almost against the windshield watching it glide over my head. As the blinding lights went past me I was able to see the shape of the craft. It had a cigar shaped center but it had wings that were curved toward the back. It was about the width of the road. I looked in my rear view mirror and saw another car coming off the ramp. They were probably going sixty miles per hour and here I am stopped in the middle of the road. I sped off and drove home. I'm in shock and constantly looking into the fields around me when I'm driving. I'm hoping that telling you my story will put my mind to rest.

MUFON,2020-01-29 6:45PM,3/3/20,,Utica,NY ,NEW YORK,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report This is my memory of a sighting when I was about 12 years old. The exact date and year are not clear but the event is. I was getting a ride home from a friend's house from her mother. We stopped on a corner that basically took us from going to east to south. When we stopped on the corner my friend's mom rolled down her window and looking east towards a big hill we call Green Mt. was a white light so large it was almost the same size as the Mt. Bigger than any lights either of us had seen on any aircraft and it was totally silent not a sound could we hear. If it was a helicopter or plane at that distance we should have heard it clearly. And it wasn't blindingly bright but it glowed very brightly (sorry not sure how to describe it). The car headlights were pointed south so it was not the headlights from the car. She rolled up her window saying ""Creeps!"". I didn't know what to think because I had never really thought about or heard of UFOs. So I wasn't really too concerned. She gunned it down the road. We went about 1/2 mile to the stop sign where we took a right turn onto my road - now heading west. She asked me to look back and see if it was still there. It was - and now it seemed to be following us and was almost on top of us. And still no sound. Now I began to feel afraid. She hit the gas pedal (it was a Porsche) and we only had about another 1/2 mile to go to turn into my driveway. The driveway was about 1/2 as long as a football field and gravel. The gravel was spitting out underneath the tires of her car. She slammed on the brakes in front of the house and we both ran in. My parents were home and immediately my father went outside to investigate. Nothing. He saw nothing. Whatever was there wasn't there anymore. No light - nothing. If it had been a plane or helicopter he would have seen or heard it. My friend's mom made it home safely and we never discussed it.

MUFON,2020-03-02 6:20PM,3/2/20,,Maple Geove,MN ,MINNESOTA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report In Tucson my 14 yr old daughter and I were sitting in the living room one night in the 90's when she grabbed her chest and started screaming. I rushed her to the e.r. where they said her muscles had been dislodged from her chest which was like a football injury when a player gets their chest wall slammed but I told them we were watching TV and they said it was impossible to happen by watching TV. I talked to another mother there and the exact thing happened to her 14 yr old daughter while watching tv. Anyway we left at midnight exactly and are only 3 minutes from the hospital. I was driving on the overpass I vaguely remember blinding light engulfing my car and my daughter screaming when suddenly my car was under the overpass facing the wrong direction engine idling and car clock flashing 1:30 a.m. 1.5 hours of lost time. I found my bearings and drove back up the overpass and there was a UFO about 7 feet above my hood. It was round about 8 feet wide made no noise had red blue and white lights spinning on the bottom of it. I was in awe driving slowly and it followed me home. My daughter was terrified and screaming go go go. We get to the house and my son and cousins are there and awake and they see it hovering over the trees behind my house for over an hour. My car had electrical problems. My cousin said someone had been on the roof trying to get in and she dreamed it was tall blonde aliens. My cousin's boyfriend heard them too. A week later my cousin went home to Iowa and has seen them there many times since. I think they must've used some sonic weapon to hit my daughter's chest wall I saw a blue portal in my room that night with many entities around a table working on something or someone. . Anyway after this my daughter had female problems and years later when she had her 1st child he is psychic like me and highly advanced. He started talking at 3 months old which No baby does. His first words were star moon bird and he always pointed to the sky. Him and I play battleship with each other without missing any. We read each other's minds. I've had migraines and pain in my left ear since experience. I was abducted again in Ruidoso NM a few years later. They took me out of my bed and up to a mountain. They were tall and shining and I knew they could destroy me with a thought. They showed me how to move things with my mind and told me I had healing power in my hands that I would need soon. My hands became warm and light came out of them. I asked them the meaning of life and one whispered it into my ear and it was so beautiful I fell to my knees and cried but when they put me back into my room I couldn't remember what they said. My dad sister sister in law brother in law nephew me my daughter cousins have all had experiences for years. These are only a couple. By the way the week after the UFO took my daughter and I I went to a UFO seminar in Tucson looking for answers and there was a Dr there with questions too from the hospital we went to that night who had seen the same UFO we did when he got off work that night. There's much more with my family but I can't fit it all here. I feel they're still here.

MUFON,2020-02-13 3:03AM,2/14/20,,Alexandria,KY ,KENTUCKY,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Wife and I were enjoying a romantic evening in our boat at night on 9.22.19 at approximately 8:10pm we were looking at the moonless and cloudless night sky and were amazed at the number of stars we could see. The bow of the boat was facing north and we were laying looking south when My wife asked what the blinding light was in the sky. Obviously it was plane and then we saw another plane then I commented on the satellite we saw higher up in the sky and told her how different it looked than the plane and then as we sat there two objects appeared about midway in the night sky from were the satellite was and where the plane was. one object proceeded to head south in a straight line across the sky in what ungodly fast wobbling speed compared to anything else in the sky but just as the object flew south the other object started to go North and stopped in the night sky and then changed directions towards the East. I and my wife were truly dumbfounded in what we just witnessed as it seemed totally unconventional that any aircraft could have that type of speed and could stop in mid air and change directions at the snap of a finger. Totally mid blowing and I thought I should share what we just witnessed. Content-type: text/html,,{jpg} Appears like a yo yo on its side,blinding,image.jpg,"Alexandria,KY "
MUFON,1974-08-30 7:00PM,1/9/20,,Vancouver,WA ,WASHINGTON,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report MY EVENT I want to start this out by telling you I was having a hard time remembering all of the details from that night. I am remembering some of this in pieces and I am trying to put it all together as one event. I have not changed what occurred I have added to it. I have talked to two co-workers and my family about this and no one else. I couldn’t put it all together at first and now slowly it is all coming back to me and I feel comfortable talking now. It wasn’t until Sept 9th that I was finally starting to piece together what happened. What I am doing is going back to before this happened and remembering my night and what I did prior to this happening. Then going forward in time and trying to remember my thoughts and actions as I was driving. I am going to format this in a timeline and walk through this with you leading up to “My Event”. I call it my event because this is not a story this is what happened these are the facts as I understand them and as I saw them happening in front of me. One thing I want everyone to know is I am not seeking attention I don’t really like being in the spotlight. I have no reason to make anything up I have no dog in this fight. Some of this will be my personal thoughts and feelings as I made my way home that night. I am 58 years old. I work for the Department of Defense (Navy) At Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton Washington. I have worked there for 31yrs. And served in the Navy for 4yrs. I live in Port Orchard Washington and where this happened is about a 30 second drive to my house. Now here is what happened. 1:30 A.M. Aug 31 2019 My shift runs from 3:30 p.m. till 2:00 A.M. We usually clean up and try to be ready to go home by 1:40 A.M. every night. And that night we did we were out by 1:40 A.M. It’s about a 5 minute walk to my car. I drove out of the shipyard and decided I wanted a beer so I stopped at a gas station in Bremerton which is right on my way home. At this point it’s about 1:50 A.M. when I left the gas station I have a 15 to 20 minute drive to my house. I get to Gorst that’s about 10 miles or so from my house and for some reason I start thinking how lonely it is out here there’s not a person or a car in sight. I got a little bit of a creepy feeling about it but I brushed it off. After all I thought to myself it’s labor day weekend everyone is out of town of course no one is going to be around. So I drove on. I get to downtown Port Orchard and as I’m driving through I couldn’t help but think about how empty it was no cars no people again I kind of got creeped out about it it reminded me of an abandoned town. Then I thought It is 2:00 A.M. everything is closed there’s no business it’s labor day weekend and kept driving. Now I’m on my final leg home I’m on Mile Hill Drive about 5 minutes from home or 3 or 4 miles. Now let’s fast forward to what started to happen. As I make my way up to my street I have to get in the left lane so I glanced over to my left and changed lanes and saw some lights through the trees I didn’t think anything of it. Now at this point I think I drove maybe 50 more feet and looked to my left and up saw some lights. I saw two sets of lights in the air parallel to my car. Three in one clump and three on the other in the shape of a triangle. One set about a football field away and the other up and in back of the first set about a football field and a half away but trailing behind the first set. Above and behind the first set of lights. That is something I remembered today another detail I didn’t remember. There is a grocery store at that corner of that intersection PJ’s market I first thought the lights were coming from the store. Then I realized that store is closed and immidiatly I did a double take and didn’t take my eye off the lights. Those lights weren’t coming from the store they were above the store and coming down they were moving. Now remember I’m in the left turn lane driving maybe 10 MPH and I could not see what this was only lights. I didn’t put two and together. That is until the first set of lights starting getting brighter and brighter they were blinding they were so bright I couldn’t see what was behind those lights what was this [deleted profanity/CMS/jpg]. My vision actually got a little blurry. So I stopped my car I was about 10 ft. from the intersecton I kept saying out loud what is this I have to watch this [deleted profanity/CMS/jpg] what is it. [deleted profanity/CMS/jpg] what is this. Don’t get out of your car just watch it and see what it is. Because I wanted to get out but didn’t I didn’t know what this was. But I wasn’t scared that’s the strange part. Now this thing is coming straight down it lit up the whole intersection it was almost directly over my car and coming down and I’m watching it and just keeps getting brighter as it’s coming down. Now this thing stops descending and I’m looking up at it maybe 150ft. in the air and to my left above the store and the lights are not in eyes anymore. I can see it It’s round slighty domed shaped on top not a radical dome a slightly rounded top. I would have to say 70 to 100ft. in diameter and flat on the bottom. It’s hovering directly across from me but only for a couple of seconds then it starts to slowly move directly over my car and down at first I couldn’t see what the bottom looked like because of the lights. As this craft moved over my car two of the lights went over my car and were not in my eyes and now I could see the bottom of this thing about half of it. It was flat and gray and it was not shiny it reminded me of the same material used on a fighter jet. I’ve seen plenty of those I know what that looks like. It could have been painted metal too. Now it’s about 50ft. from the top of my car about 30ft. above the power lines I saw one landing gear perfectly it was retracted to it’s belly half white half metal and it had a tire on it I could see it it was that close. The one light was recessed into the belly like what would be in the ceiling in a home. The craft was rotating as well as moving to my right. It moved directly over my car. It started moving further over my car. So I pressed my face up against the window so I could see what it was doing. Now I can only see the very edge of it so I leaned over my steering wheel to see what I can see above me. I looked up and what I saw was a smaller craft about 20ft. wide hovering in front of me and a little to the left across the street above the power lines it rotated in place and was now sideways to me. I could see the windows they were blacked out about a half dozen but they were small this was a smaller craft. The fuselage ran the whole length of the craft and stuck out the back end. The craft was not completely round round in the front and batwing shaped in the back and the fuselage hung out over the back it was round and came to a point. If you look at a stingray that’s what it looked but not round in the back. Also remember the intersection is still lit up the big one is still above me and I have no Idea about where the second set of lights went at the beginning of all this. Ok so now the small craft is in front of me hovering sideways it flies toward the center of the intersection makes a left drops down to about 10 ft. above the road flying east towards Seattle. And then the lights go out the intersection goes back to normal with the street lights on. I’m fixated at this little craft flying directly in front of me down the street. It flies for a couple of blocks and illuminates in a light red glow. I’m absolutely amazed at this point I can’t believe what I’m seeing. It’s glowing red and just takes off faster than anything I have ever seen. I can see Seattle and the water from where I am. It flew over the water left a green luminescent trail behind it over the water I saw bright white flash over the mountains and it disappeared in probably a second or two. I saw no jet blast and heard no sound. Picture this I’m in the middle of the road in the middle of night not one car not one person all by myself wondering what the [deleted profanity/CMS/jpg] just happened. It took me about 10 seconds after it was all over to figure out what do. I just stared straight ahead in disbelief and looked up to my left. I said time to go home and drove home. My son was home I couldn’t tell him I couldn’t tell anybody at that point. I was trying to comprehend what just happened. The next couple of days were kind of strange. I felt very alone and kind of trapped. I have been very confused in my own thoughts. Carrying on a conversation has been very hard unless I’m talking about this and even then my thoughts wonder. Since this happened I’m a little paranoid driving home at night and I’m wondering when they’re coming back. Because they will be back. To me that’s they’re take off point. That’s not the first time they’ve launched from that point. It was to precise to fast and absolutely flawless. And all of it lasted I would say at most from beginning to end maybe 25 seconds. And that’s with me watching the small craft fly down the road. How did they know to take off from there? It’s their runway. Like I said they’ll be back whether I see it or not is another story. But somebody will. Now it’s time for a dash cam. I wish I would have had one. So anyway I will end this right here. I want you all to know I love you all very much and we’ll talk soon. 9/11/19 Content-type: text/html,,{jpg} Very large glowing white light - silent,blinding,,"Vancouver,WA "
MUFON,1995-08-18 10:30PM,10/4/19,,Tucson,AZ ,ARIZONA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Have been awoken by blinding flashes of light before... I sleep in the basement with large sliding glass doors to the right of where the bed is. Awoke one night after a flash which seems to light the entire room or come from inside my head. My laptop had timed out which I usually sleep with playing music. I closed the lid and was looking for the charger. No lights were on in the room no music. No curtains over glass doors. Looked outside and saw a small glowing blue-white orb about the size of a small peach very near to the door (about 3 inches away and from my spot in the bed about 15 feet) and maybe 3 feet off the ground. Very close to the door... Pulsated and stayed in one spot. It was not the reflection of anything from inside the room on the glass no lights or outlets were on... I watched for a few moments scared and captivated. I reached around blindly for my phone to take a photo. As soon as I touched my phone the light blinked out. I got chills and set my phone down the light came back on winking before going out for good. No sounds. No other lights that night. Not the first time lights have been seen outside. I live near a swamp so people tell me swamp lights/gas but every time I go to take a photo the lights disappear as if intelligent. Usually above treeline or high in the sky blue or white no sound.

There are no roads South of the house just pasture lands and woods. I looked to the South side and saw this brilliant light shining in the windows a quick glance to the North windows showed no lights. I arose from the bed and pulled the curtain back and there was blinding light that lasted for maybe 5-6 seconds. The light was so bright I could not ascertain where it was emitting from from. The second the lights came on the coyotes stopped calling my dachshund was on the bed shivering.As I said I could not see anything due to the brightness of the light.

As we drove further down the road the object flying straight crossed the road in the front of us and went to the left side of the road and was traveling at a high speed and went through the woods to the left. The shape of the object was hard to make since the light coming from it was so bright and almost blinding but my guess from the size would be oval shaped. Had to be traveling several hundred mph and was about the size compared to a car. The object was glowing with an outlined aura it light up the area around it and even luminated the woods around it . It made a humming sound as it flew past in the front of us flying leveled . Out of fear of what we saw I drove very fast to get out of that area.

This light was blinding and illuminated the entire inside of my Jeep it gave off what the strangest noise Like that of a Tesla coil.

MUFON,2019-07-24 9:34PM,7/25/19,,Newton,NJ ,NEW JERSEY,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was coming home from a girls friends house years ago at 2 Am It just snowed a inch or two and I was driving my car on RT 9 south of the town of New Castle. The sky had low clouds and it was dark being 2 AM. The only reason I can describe the clouds is because the light flash I witnessed was so bright it light up the sky but the clouds were those low bumpy ones that you see after or before a storm. I have only seen a few things brighter then this and one was a flash from a old 35 MM the kind that when you turned it on it made a noise and when it was charged up it would work. I once set a flash off in a dark room and it blinded me and had that spot in my eye for a while. The light I witnessed was the same thing and It happened right over my head Just above the clouds. When the event was done I had to pull over and let my eyes clear up so I could see in the dark again. In my opinion this was the exhaust from a craft. What ever craft made this light was sitting still first you had that blinding white flash then it emitted a light spectrum with all the colors of the rainbow behind it. Its hard to describe but what ever it was moved out of site in under a second to say it took of like a bullet is a under statement. The spectrum of light was very vivid and probable 100 foot wide and each color was 200 long. It took a long time report this but I had to.

MUFON,12:00AM,6/20/19,,Sinclairville,NY ,NEW YORK,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report It was like looking at a diamond but huge. As I moved the colors ran the rainbow. Except this wasn't more than 3 acre's away. The sighting happened just after midnight last night as I was sitting on my back porch. The entire thing began at 12:02am. I looked at my phone before I went outside. It only lasted just a few minutes. Approximately 3 minutes I would say. I live out in the country my neighbors and myself are surrounded by forest. Each property is approximately an acre to give you some reference. I happened to look to my right and approximately 2-3 acre's away I saw lights. They would have been maybe six feet off the ground. There were six but stacked Vertical. Like this:. : : : I couldn't see the object the lights were so bright they were blinding me and I could feel them on my face. A warm feeling. Here's the bizzare thing as I sat there I instinctively moved side to side trying to get a better look. As I did the lights changed colors with my movement. Orange blue green red white. It made me think of how a diamond catches light. I also realized that the entire forest had gone completely silent. No frog's croaking no dogs barking nothing. This event continued for about two minutes and then suddenly the lights were gone. No sound nothing. I checked and I didn't lose any time and no other issues. I certainly hope this helps you and if you have any questions always feel free to contact me. Please don't worry about how long it takes to get back to me. I'm just so glad that I was able to report this. Even though this is not by a long shot my first experience it was the most unnerving.

MUFON,2018-01-17 2:00AM,6/16/19,,New Castle,DE ,DELAWARE,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was driving in my car and seen two round lights in the sky. They were stationary. Very bright. Not blinding but extremely noticable. But this had been happening to me for a few months. I had been seeing these lights that are very bright and obvious sometimes it's an orange fiery one but usually it's a bright white very starlike but very close to earth. I have been going through some spiritual issues during the time and can see meta entities.so I mostly brushed it off as a result of my spiritual issues but I was with an anonymous friend this time and he seen the lights as well. So I knew they were physical and not meta. I see them often. Although recently I have noticed alot of aircraft in the air lately and I think it's to cover them up. And I notice lapses in my memory about it. Hazy memory. I feel almost like I wrestle with something to recall detail. It's strange. But these UFO's are absolutely physical and not meta. And I have witnessed them at least a dozen times though. Content-type: text/html,,{rjl} Brightest light you can imagine,blinding,,"New Castle,DE "
MUFON,12:00AM,5/25/19,,Philadelphia,PA ,PENNSYLVANIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report My former co-worker and I were outside on break on opposite ends of the parking lot. He was looking at his phone and I was smoking a cigarette talking to him about something work related. Suddenly both of us look straight up at the sky without a word to each other. All I can see coming towards me at a super high rate of speed is a really bright orb object. It was almost as if it noticed me looking directly at it because no sooner do I realize it's not a normal aircraft than a blinding light starts reflecting off the surface of the craft. I looked down to grab my phone off the wall I was standing beside and as I looked up but before I could open my camera app the aircraft changed directions and streaked away at speeds I've never imagined before. My co-worker and I were stunned and could hardly believe what we had seen. We had trouble articulating our apparent shock and jubilation for the remainder of our shift. We talked about what it had looked like and while I described an Orb that started reflecting light to hide itself my co-worker described and drew an oblong craft -- everything else about his recollection coincided with mine. Now thinking about the event fills me with a sort of existential dread and gives me a slight amount of anxiety.

MUFON,2019-05-22 12:02AM,5/22/19,,Calhoun,GA ,GEORGIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was 12 years old when I had my encounter. It was about 1am on a Friday night during the early spring of 1994. I was watching a movie in the living room while both of my parents were asleep. (The room is on the ground level and has two large windows that face west to an open field both were covered by thin curtains at the time.) While laying on the sofa I began to simultaneously hear a low frequency hum and feel a vibration. I remember being initially confused as to whether or not it was mechanical or something natural like a mild earthquake. The intensity of the vibrating hum gradually and steadily increased. Within a few seconds the curtains became illuminated with a bright orange light. This lasted only a few seconds before fading away. When this happened I became more curious the curtains would grow in a similar way from the headlights of a car in our driveway but I knew this was different so I sat up quickly to look out of the window. When I stood up the hum came back instantly but with a deafening intensity and the room became completely illuminated with a blinding orange light. I remember the event vividly up to this point. Approximately ten seconds passed between hearing/feeling the hum of the first illumination and the rapid beginning of the second more intense illumination. Overwhelmed by panic and fear I tightly squeezed my eyes closed and covered my head with a blanket to block out the light and sound. I remained motionless and didn’t move from that position. Eventually the room felt calm and I began to peek around I slowly rose to my feet then sprinted to my parent’s bedroom. I cannot recall how much time passed between the second illumination and my next memory between 5 minutes and 3 hours have been blocked out. I know it was about 1am when the encounter began and it was several hours before sunrise when I removed the blanket from my head and ran to my parent’s room.

MUFON,2019-02-01 7:00PM,4/7/19,,Roy,UT ,UTAH,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I am an Airline Transport Pilot and have been flying for 52 years. I'm also a USAF Veteran and former Physiological Training Instructor and trained in observation of aircraft and in flight atmospheric phenomena. I was stationed at Cannon AFB NM from 1968 to 1972 (active) and have many flying hours logged at night over this part of the country. I have observed over the years many phenomena even in-flight fairly close meteor sightings at night. On the night of 22 Feb 2007 we were flying a Lear 31A from Addison TX (ADS) to Palm Springs CA (PSP) at FL470 when we observed what was first thought to be a flight of four aircraft behind a tanker over the Phoenix area. At the time we were just about over El Paso. It was a clear night and at that altitude visibility was unlimited. We could see Tucson and Phoenix both very clearly. We then realized that we were too far to be observing aircraft at that distance. Not thinking much about it we continued and were taking engine perimeters for a flight into Tucson later that evening for maintenance. As we drew closer to Phoenix they continued to be very bright. There were five lights total and they changed formation slightly as time went on. I then realized that they were within the Luke AFB (MOA) the top of the MOA is FL450 and as we looked down on them we could see the ground lights beneath these lights they were about the size of a baseball. At that point they went out one at a time and after a few minutes reappeared and then out. We continued and after about five minutes or so I noticed that two had reappeared again off the left side of the aircraft and slightly below and then went out. We estimated that they were approximately at FL200 which was about 27 000 feet below our altitude as we flew over them however when the two objects reappeared off the left side of the aircraft they were much closer about the size of a grapefruit. They were bright but not blinding. When we returned from PSP later that evening to TUC they were gone. Thinking back we were both so mesmerized by these lights neither one of us even thought to go for a camera which was in my flight bag in the back of the aircraft. We never perceived any thought of a threat during the entire event. We continued flight normally and there was never any mention of the lights by any other aircraft or by ATC itself and we did not report the sighting as you can imagine. I am certain that we were not the only crew to observe these lights. I have a saying about lights in the sky at night and that is that they are only lights in the sky at night! I very carefully observed this sighting and took notes to it's account. To this day I feel blessed to have observed whatever it was at such a close range without incident and to be able to pass on the information to an organization that might have an interest. I no longer fly professionally only as a part-time fill-in pilot for a small corporation. That is why I'm sharing this information at this time. My personal opinion of this event is that it must have been military in nature. Remember that it did take place within the Luke MOA and I think that is key. As a trained observer I have always tried to be rational in my observations and not jump to any conclusion or allow imagination to take control.

MUFON,2018-06-15 1:00PM,4/1/19,,Meadville,PA ,PENNSYLVANIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Hello everyone the day was Friday the date January 4th 2019. I was on a road trip in Nevada was my first time I went to Pyramid Lake. It was around noon sometime I stopped by the lake to take some pictures with my phone. I was taken pics of the lake and Pyramid island when I did a 180� turn and took a picture the sun was blinding I couldnt tell if I got a pic so I took another one just seconds after the first. Then I got in my truck and explored some more terrain did you know there is huge petrified rocks of coral around Pyramid Lake yeah I like geological exploration. Yeah I spent a few more hours around the lake then I went along with my road trip. It wasnt till later that night when I was looking thru my phone pics I noticed the blue luminous sphere in 2 of my pics at first I thought it waa just a spec on my lens. Yet it wasnt in any of my other pics just the 2 pics tooken seconds apart. According to my 2 pics the sphere was moving ascending into the sky or traveling south to north approximately. And the object appears to be miles high and away almost as a tiny luminous blue moon.

MUFON,1994-04-08 1:00AM,3/17/19,,Pekin,IL ,ILLINOIS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report WE WHERE AT HIGH ROCKS OREGON ON A OVERNIGHT CAMPING TRIP. THE CAMPING LOCATION IS ON A BLUFF WITH 360 DEGREE VIEW. TOWARDS THE END OF THE NIGHT THE FIRE BURNT OUT AND INSTEAD OF PUTTING UP THE TENT WE JUST GOT BACK IN THE CAR AND STARTED IT TO WARM UP. WHILE HANGING OUT IN VEHICLE WE DECIDED TO MESS WITH THE HEADLIGHTS TURNING THEM ON AND OFF. THE FIRST TIME WE NOTICED THE LIGHT IT WAS TO OUR FAR LEFT AT THE BASE OF THE CANYON MOVING HORIZONTALLY TO THE RIGHT. THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE MOVING BEHIND THE TREES AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. I THOUGHT IT COULD POSSIBLY BE A DIRT BIKE OR QUAD. THE LIGHT FIRST APPEARED AT THE BASE OF THE CANYON MOVING TO THE RIGHT BEHIND THE TREES ONCE THE LIGHT GOT DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF US IT TURNED AND HEADED STRAIGHT TOWARDS US. EVENTUALLY THE LIGHT WENT OUT OF SIGHT BELOW US BECAUSE OF THE ANGLE OF THE BLUFF. AT THIS POINT MY 2 FRIENDS BECAME AFRAID THAT IT WAS A UFO. I WAS DOUBTFUL SO I GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND STEPPED TO THE EDGE OF THE BLUFF AND LOOKED OVER. SEEING NOTHING I TURN AROUND AND AS I TURN I SEE THE BLUFF BECOMING FLOODED WITH BRILLIANT LIGHT. THE EYES OF BOTH MY FRIENDS WIDE IN DISBELIEF I TURN BACK AROUND AND THERE IN THE SKY IS A EXTREMELY BRIGHT LIGHT HOVERING AT 45 DEGREE ABUT 20 TO 30 FEET AWAY. THE LIGHT WAS BLINDING BUT SILENT NO NOISE WHATSOEVER. I FELT FROZEN IN PLACE FOR A MOMENT. THEN I WAS ABLE TO TURN AROUND AND RAN TO THE CAR THAT MY FRIENDS WHERE ALREADY TURNING AROUND. I DOVE INTO THE BACK WINDOW AND WE TORE DOWN A 5 MPH ROAD AT ABOUT 40 MPH. Content-type: text/html,,{rjl} Witnessed from living room with curtains closed.,blinding,,"Pekin,IL "
MUFON,2007-02-22 12:00AM,2/6/19,,Phoenix,AZ ,ARIZONA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report My encounter with aliens In order to tell my alien encounter story about five years ago which has nothing to do with flying objects I have to give you as brief a description of the layout of my condominium. It is on the ground floor of a 6 floor condominium. My unit is the last unit on the first floor at the extreme end of the first floor. My unit is long and narrow. It is divided into two equal divisions. Imagine yourself coming into the right half from the outside corridor. Ahead directly across the entire area of the right half you will see a huge floor to ceiling sliding door type window. Beyond that you will see my large patio. This patio is completely surrounded by a waist high iron railing. Immediately beyond the railing on all three sides are very high shrubs very thickly grown together. The shrubs are routinely topped so that they do not interfere with the view of the occupant of the unit above me considerably up over and above me. Because of the thick bushes it is next to impossible to access my patio from outside. In short the patio is a very private area with the sky seen only immediately above the patio or away up high beyond the tops of the very high-growing shrubs. In summer I set up my outdoor table set and umbrella. Next imagine yourself walking down this right half of my condo toward that window. Half way down on your left is a door which gives access to the other half of my condo. Enter the door turn right and look down across this area. There you will see again a huge sliding door type window and again you will see through the window one half left half of my patio. (You had seen only the right half of the patio in the right half of the condo.) So of course there is a thick wall dividing the two halves. My bed is in the left half near the left window. It is laying parallel to the window so that when I lie there I can see the left half of the patio through the window. In the right half of this window in front of the window is my computer. (No curtains on either window) At about 11 P.M. in February of a year I can�t remember about five years ago I was awakened by the realization that there was some sort of light not a reflection on the wall or ceiling but a light somewhere that had awakened me. I happened to have been sleeping facing the window. I first looked directly out of the window. It was completely dark outside impossible to see even the patio. I was quite surprised to see a light away down in the left corner of the window outside just above on the floor of the patio there. Now this light was very strange. It was about the size and shape of a brick. It didn�t shine like an ordinary light although it was quite bright completely white making the �brick� a single entirely white object. There was no aura that is associated with any ordinary light bulb or flashlight. It definitely was not the light of a flashlight. There was no reflection on any wall or on the ceiling. I was curious and more so when this �brick� light began to move very slowly along and across the very bottom of the window. Outside of course it passed behind one leg of my computer stand. It disappeared. It reappeared in the area between the left and right leg disappeared behind the right left momentarily appeared and then disappeared as it passed beyond the wall that separated the two divisions of my condo. I was then quite curious. I got out of bed walked to the connecting door to see if the light was also there at the bottom of the window at right half of my condo. It was there still slowly moving across the bottom of that window. Remember I was first just standing in the connecting door looked over and down at the window. I didn�t turn on any lights. The entire condo was pitch black except for that non-reflecting light. Well I moved into the right half of my condo so that I was standing half way down toward that high right window. That light kept moving toward the right. I moved a bit closer. I think I was becoming a bit frightened. It was so strange. Then as the light moved clear across the bottom of the window and was about to disappear or so I thought beyond the left wall of my condo. (which is on the very right end portion of the entire building so that there are no condos units beyond the right wall.) �..I took a further step toward the window. Well at that very moment of my movement toward the window and just as the light reached the lower portion of the right wall Wow! A tremendous unbelievable blinding white light seared up from that �brick� light and illuminated that entire right half of my condo with such brilliance that I remember I could see the small printing on the on the back of a book in my book shelf there. I can�t say that I myself was particularly blinded by the light it was just that everything in the room became so clearly visible every minute detail! Because of that light I became quite frightened BUT at the same time I can�t say why�I sensed that whatever was out there hadn�t realized I was watching but somehow became aware of my figure in the dark. In short they were as surprised as I was. Well I am the type of person who has to know what is what. I swear to God It didn�t take me more that three seconds to walk I didn�t run I was still scared to the window and open it. Of course I looked to the right there outside. Even in the darkness I could see there was absolutely nothing. Nothing anywhere on my patio. That in a way was more of a shock than seeing that light. If that light had been burglars they would have had to haul a gigantic dynamo through the shrubs and over the railing to have made such a light. It would have been impossible for them to escape so quickly. Even if they only had a flashlight (which it certain wasn�t) Nobody could possibly have jumped over the railing and escaped off that patio and through that thick under growth in two or even three or four or more minutes without me seeing them or at least hearing them fight their way through the undergrowth. To me the only answer is that they were really aliens. Out there on the patio which was too dark at that time to see anything through the windows except that light there must have been some sort of ship evidently small to fit on my patio or maybe hovering over the patio for them to make their Houdini escape. If they were aliens then that would be no problem. We all have read of how quickly they move. And they certainly have advanced beyond dynamos. I am not a technician type person at all but later thinking about that light I was reminded of a picture of a laser light I had seen. But it was very very tiny used in surgical operations. Talking to skeptical friends I learned that there is no such thing as a laser light the size of a brick. The light looked to me exactly like the non-aura look of a laser light. The light formed a perfect square contained inside that square�no aura of any sort. What remains for me after thinking and remembering that experience are two things: I came to have a sense of kinship with them. They are after all not entirely different from us. They were as surprised to see me as I was to experience them. And most of all I have this gnawing yearning for them to come back. Just like those characters in the movie �Encounters of the Third Kind� I have this inexplicable desire to experience them again.

MUFON,2019-01-04 1:00PM,1/11/19,,Nixon,NV ,NEVADA,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report PREFACE: I want you to understand that the boxes I checked in the above section of this report form were required and because they were required I tried to choose the most appropriate under the circumstances. I did not know how to explain this event in any better way without writing my narrative because as you will see the event is not typical in that it does not share the standard format. I have no intention of misleading anyone; I was simply trying to do the best I could under the circumstances required before I had a chance to explain. BACKGROUND: I was formally trained as a research scientist at the undergraduate and graduate level focusing primarily in psychology and physics. At one time I subscribed to your Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) newsletter when I was living in Los Angeles when Walter Andrus was the director. (I might still have some of those original newsletters which I seem to recall being published in a paper magazine format with a subdued yellow cover.) At the time I was very interested and even had thoughts of becoming a formal UFO investigator which I unfortunately never pursued. Anyway I have been interested in the subject for most of my life and now understand that I have had many incidents of significance relating to this interest. CATALYST: I have known about this particular incident for about 15 to 20 years now telling others whom I felt might understand especially those I thought might be able to provide some kind of insightful answer for me. But this evening I was watching the MUFON ""Hangar 1"" documentary series which I recently discovered was being offered on my streaming video system. I had already watched the first episode regarding UFO hot spots and the second episode about alien body recovery and tonight I began watching the third in the series about police encounters with UFO's. TURNING POINT: When I watched the sequence describing the two police officers and what they experienced with the overhead craft and paralyzing (although they later broke free) beam of light the event suddenly came vividly back to me and although I do intend to watch the rest of the episode (as well as the rest of the entire series) I felt I had no choice but to stop watching the video look up MUFON headquarters and attempt to report the event. Within my extended family and circle of friends I have had ample opportunities to relate this story in hopes of gaining insight from someone in law enforcement and have done so. but not one to date has ever been able to explain what happened. They all say that they have no idea what occurred and although I know that their denial could be a cover story fabrication knowing them all as I do I truly tend to believe them. Maybe you won't understand it either but it seems to me to be the best chance I have to get it across to someone who might. I am completely willing to take that chance. TIME LINE: I know that this is vague but it's the best that I can do for now. Maybe I can look into it and narrow it down further but presently I believe that as best I can recall it occurred sometime between the beginning of 1998 and the end of 2001. I know this because I am certain of the vehicle I was driving and the passenger who accompanied me. LOCATION: San Diego County traveling southbound in the center lane on CA State Route Highway 67 between CA State Route Highway 52 and the US Interstate 8 Freeway. TIME OF DAY: Estimated approximately between 10:00AM and 11:00AM plus or minus one hour at most. CONDITIONS: Light to medium traffic sunny and clear atmospheric conditions comfortably warm temperature approximately 80 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit not noticeably humid. We were driving on a pleasant day in unremarkable traffic on a beautiful sunny mid-morning. INCIDENT: We were driving casually with the windows open and carrying on a light conversation. At one point in the conversation when I turned slightly to my right to face my passenger I noticed what I first thought was a California State Highway Patrol cruiser coming up on my right. My passenger noticed my attention and also turned to the right to see what I was looking at. By that time the driver of the vehicle had pulled up alongside of my car and was holding a constant speed to remain perfectly side-by-side with us so that his left front door window was even with my right front door window. We had a perfectly clear view in that position for maybe ten or fifteen seconds. DETAILS: I noticed several things which stood out to me. For one thing although the car seemed unremarkable type and markings appearance sound etc. I immediately noticed that it was unusual that there would be two officers in the car. I had quite often seen Highway Patrol vehicles on this stretch of highway as their local headquarters is located nearby but I had never seen a patrol car with two officers inside. The ones I had seen were always driven by a lone officer. MORE DETAILS: And another thing their uniforms looked different. They were both wearing identical uniforms that were completely dark blue with no exception. I had never seen them wear dark clothing in this area they always wore light colors tan khaki presumably and understandably to reflect the heat in this climate. My passenger and I looked on (I had to drive so I couldn�t maintain a constant gaze) and they looked at us in a way that seemed very unusual for law enforcement officers. They made no attempt at communication verbally or otherwise they simply both kept obviously looking at us. As far as I could tell there was nothing particularly interesting about us so I was beginning to become very curious puzzled by this behavior. It was really becoming unnerving. Then a really unusual thing happened. PEAK EXPERIENCE: As I already explained I was driving the car so I could not maintain a constant gaze on the patrol car or its occupants; I had to briefly break eye contact just often enough to maintain safe awareness of driving conditions. But as fortune would have it I was able to observe the following behavior without interruption: The two (presumably male) officers sat side-by-side in the front seat of their car and at that particular moment the one sitting in the passenger seat leaned forward so that I could clearly see his entire upper body torso. He held out something in his hands some kind of object. I could not make out any distinguishing features but it appeared to be a dark square (or nearly so) box that I would estimate to be approximately 10� on each side flat black in color with no protruding features I could see. Then while still leaning forward in his seat and facing us he lifted the object not quite shoulder high but enough to clear the window opening of their car and it emitted an instantaneous blinding flash of intense white light. Even in broad daylight on a perfectly clear day the brilliant light flash was dazzling enough to create a momentary blindness and I struggled blinking to maintain my orientation� I was still driving a car at about 65 miles per hour on the highway in traffic. Needless to say I was stunned and incredulous as to processing what had happened. Now this took a moment for me to describe it verbally to you now but what happened next did not. At the very moment the flash occurred and even though I was somewhat unable to see for a moment the driver of the patrol car hit the gas and took off like a proverbial shot� at which point another very unusual thing happened: I hit the gas and took off after them in hot pursuit. WHAT�S GOING ON HERE?: I can�t explain how or why I responded the way I did but I took off after them with a vengeance. They were trying to outrun me and there was no way I was going to let them get away. Crazy. TRADING PLACES: I was in hot pursuit of this patrol car for several miles they were weaving in and out of traffic like crazy cutting off cars at speeds well over 100 miles per hour and I was on their tail the entire time matching their every move. It�s really something the way an adrenaline rush takes over and you become dead-set on your mission� it wasn�t like it was the most important thing to focus on� it was the ONLY thing to focus on. The realization that I had never done anything like this before never once even remotely occurred to me. As far as I was concerned there was no way they were going to get away from me and that was final. We had traded places if not in physical appearances in spirit consciousness identity. A MOMENT OF REFLECTION: Like I said this high speed chase went on for several miles with no sign of letting up� I had become totally at home in this frame of mind like it was second nature to me and gradually became more and more �ordinary� until while continuing quite comfortable in my role I vaguely noticed a distant thought cross my mind: Exactly what did I think I was I going to do if I caught them? I then realized that for all outward appearances I was a civilian in a domestic automobile pursuing what appeared to be two uniformed law enforcement officers in an apparently appropriately marked patrol car. Did I think I was going to pull them over and arrest them? Issue them a traffic citation? Maybe let them off with a warning? What? EPILOGUE: Well the longer I though along these lines the more I lost immediate interest in the pursuit and gradually slowed down until I merged uneventfully back into the stream of traffic. And I hoped it stayed that way at least until I could get off the highway and out of the car to think about this whole affair� which fortunately is exactly what happened. And thought about it I have for about twenty years now. No one I�ve ever related this incident to claimed to have any knowledge about that box or what it was for. To me it felt like looked like and appeared to be some kind of camera. But I suspect it has to do with something more like maybe space-time dimensional adjustment/alignment... ...after all there�s gotta be a whole lot easier and less conspicuous ways to get my picture. But I never forgot they day when I was in high-speed pursuit of the cops� if indeed they were cops. Or maybe it was the day I chased a UFO.

MUFON,1994-06-30 11:50PM,1/10/19,,GOVERNMENT CAMP / High Ro,OR ,OREGON,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report I take people to the high desert in the Big Bend area in Texas. All other 5 people had gone out into desert to camp alone leaving me alone in base camp. The sun had set behind the Blue Ridge of the Solotario geological formation NW of Terlingua Tx about 10 miles. Looking to the SW I see a glowing white light with double appearance. It flew directly at me from far off in Mexico air space. This vehicle flew directly at me and over my head less than 100 feet. 2 large solid spheres glowing white connected between them by large tube structure with the 2 spheres quite close together flying forward side by side. Very hard to determine how large but vehicle was very large completely silent. Passed directly over my head and proceeded in direct line to the NE until it disappeared. This was the second day in the desert camping. Very remote area. I was preparing my camp for the coming night. I was stunned and simply stared as I watched it come directly at me and directly over my head. So stunned I did not even think to grab my phone or camera. It was not glowing so bright I could see it was a solid vehicle. I have never reported this before. I have never heard of this type vehicle before. I am curious to know if you at mufon have heard or have record of this type object. There is no doubt to me this object was not from Earth and intentionally flew directly over my head. Too coincidental in that very large open remote land to pass directly over my head by accident. I can provide sketch. The tube connecting the spheres was approximately 1/3 diameter of the diameter of the spheres which were identical. The tube was not long such that the spheres were quite close together. The vehicle total size was clearly larger than a 747 jumbo jet for reference. Completely silent and moving approximately 20 mph or less. Passed over very slowly and never changed speed that I could tell unless there was some acceleration after passing over because it disappeared within 2 minutes. ************************************ Info update 10DEC18: Lance Crawford 1:24 AM to me Interesting drawings and pic. What I saw was a smooth uniform surface over the entire 2 spheres and cross cylinder connecting them. The entire object appeared luminous rather than ""glowing"". It was quite bright but not blinding. If that helps. Of course that could change - the the pic of the dual lights in the sky. And like I said I would modify that drawing - larger spheres and very close together connected by short cylinder. I need to sleep. Up in 4 hours to go to work. I will draw again for more accuracy of what I saw ******************************** Lance Crawford 1:10 AM (7 hours ago) to me OK then. I was going to modify my drawing. The spheres were larger and closer together But it was moving forward spheres side by side. I do hope to see it again. I was too stunned I suppose to walk to my truck and grab my phone with camera. I was waiting to see what would happen next since it flew right at me and overhead. Never even thought to take a pic. The object filled about a quarter to a third of my field of vision meaning it was very large or that close overhead. No sound or other reference to determine that. Thank you for the information. Have you in your research ever come across the names Monka Kasumi or The Eagle Command? I was one of the twelve asked to speak at the Roswell 50th anniversary event in Roswell. I was asked to talk about the Native American references to UFO's. In so doing I included the predominant attitude of our Earth and loss of respect. The purpose was to provide the context in which Native America perceives ""the star people"" or ""space or heaven Brothers"" as translated in English. I feel connection to the Earth - or loss of that - that I spoke of went over the head of many or disregarded in ignorance or in some cases resentment. This is - in part - some of what I have been asked to speak about for 40 years I did this full time for 8 years until I was burned out with people contacting me at all hours non-stop. And then this incident of the fly over occurred in the desert when I had 5 people out on Vision Quest with me holding center in base camp by myself. I ""feel"" without doubt the fly over was intentional. That is all I know about that but it would take a long story to define the context for me in which it occurred. And no there were no drugs or Medicines involved in Vision Quest. And i was not fasting as were those out on Quest alone. I had to be ready and strong enough if any of them needed help or there was an emergent situation. I also had to be focused and clear of mind to remain in contact with those out alone and pray for them. This state of mind may explain in part why I did not think to take a picture. I did ask them 4 days later when they returned to base camp and we concluded silence in Ceremony if they had seen anything in the sky. Turned out all 5 were down sleeping or resting under a tarp for shade at the time it occurred.

MUFON,2013-02-11 11:00PM,1/8/19,,Seattle,WA ,WASHINGTON,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was in the Louisiana Army National Guard at summer camp in Fort Chaffee Arkansas on the parade grounds about 8 pm. Many of us had our own small transistor radios with us so that we could listen to music. There were about 100 other soldiers there who also witnessed the same thing I did. There were five arrow head shaped flying objects in the sky to my right flying together in a v-formation. They glowed a very bright white and at arm's length they were about the size of a silver dollar. They stopped moving and hovered over us. In succession starting from their right one would leave the formation take off and do all kinds of stop and go zig-zag manuevers. In turn all five did the same thing. We all watched for about fifteen minutes. While we were witnessing this we heard broadcasts on the local am station with callers mentioning the same thing were were seeing. When a military jet approached from their left they all took off at a blinding speed.

I IMMINENTLY FELT OBLIGATED TO SCREAM INSIDE FOR MY MOTHER TO SHOW HER WHAT WAS GOING ON. HOWEVER IT WAS 12:36 AM AND MY MOTHER IS A LIGHT SLEEPER BUT WAS ABSOLUTELY PASSED OUT IN BED REGARDLESS OF MY ERRATIC VOICE CALLING TO HER THAT NIGHT! I HAD THEN RAN BACK TO THE DECK WHICH SEEMED LIKE 5 SECONDS ONLY TO FIND 2 BRILLIANT EXTREMELY BRIGHT LIGHTS CLOAKING A GIGANTIC OBJECT IN THE SKY. AT THIS POINT I HAD SLOUCHED MY BODY DOWNWARD AND RAISED MY LEFT HAND TO BLOCK THE CLOAKING LIGHT ONLY TO REALIZE THAT WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE LIGHTING HAD BEEN A GIGANTIC TRIANGULAR CRAFT 40yrdx40yrdx40yrd about 75 -150 ft max ABOVE ME (75ft ALMOST SURE) AT A 60 DEGREE VIEWING ANGLE.

MUFON,2016-05-00 3:30PM,11/2/18,,Terlingua,TX ,TEXAS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report My daughter from Alaska was in bedroom with lights off and TV on it was around 1230 midnight Friday 10/19/18. Two bright lights similar to head lights but about 4-5 times size of car headlights was lighting up the bedroom and she got up to look out window which is a large window. There was absolutely no sound. She was to shocked to call me as I have been ill and was in the upstairs bedroom. It was close to the house in the yard Our place total 5 acres is completely fenced except for a small area by side of house a vehicle could drive into back yard but we would have heard the sound and my dogs go nuts and bark at the slightest sound at night and they never woke up It would have been difficult to have driven into back yard and turned a vehicle to face the house because there is an electric fence across the yard about 1/2 to a short block long from the house back to the electric fence so our neighbor can put his horses in our field behind our lawn in back yard. She watched out the window for probably 10 to 15 minutes and as the lights were pulsating it was gone. The lights were so bright she could not see shape of object except the bright lights and there was no sound at all when it left and the lights were too blinding to see any shape of it. This was so strange because years ago in the 70's s similar incident happened at my grandparents place late at night in Cashmere Washington but we never reported it.

MUFON,1967-08-24 12:00AM,10/29/18,,Fort Smith,AR ,ARKANSAS,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report I was home at 718 Shoal Creek Road in Canton Georgia. I was about 20 years old and I had a friend staying with me and we were the only people there. We fell asleep around midnight on the floor in front of the fireplace. I remember hearing an enormous amount of rain suddenly dumping out of the sky and this deluge was so loud it awoke me. I stood and as I did so I witnessed out of the east picture windows a blindingly white beam of light shoot straight down out of the sky. A large glowing ball descended within this beam and landed across the creek about 200 feet away. As I stared in disbelief (I began to think I was dreaming) these smaller orbs emerged from the bigger one and sort of ""bounce-drifted"" a few feet off the ground. They bounced onto the top rail of a cedar fence and continued together in a line along the top of the fence coming towards me. I can't even explain the feeling of terror that overcame me and I felt an absolute compulsion to hide. Something inside me warned me that they would come in the house looking for me so I turned around and slinked out the back door (where they wouldn't see me). I hid in the carport between my mom's car and the wall where I could peek out and see them. They kept coming in my direction and then when they got all the way to me I can't remember what happened next. I awoke later right in front of the fireplace where I had originally fallen asleep however I and my friend were both soaked from head to toe with freezing rainwater. He has never spoken to me about the events of that night nor I to him. I don't know if he saw anything at all. Years later I discovered that BOTH of my brothers have had eerily similar experiences with sightings occurring in the exact same landing spot.

MUFON,2014-10-07 12:00AM,10/28/18,,Monroe,NJ ,NEW JERSEY,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report I woke up around 8 am and did all my usual chores made coffee got the paper and made breakfast.Felt great first day I woke up with no headache. I went to the shower and as soon as the water hit my skin spots on my body started burning. Then it all came rushing to me what had taken place. My first reaction was trembling and sobbing uncontrollably.My wife was at the bathroom sink and ran to me in the shower. She thought I had hurt myself. Then I told her that I was visited sometime during the night by a very tall being with no features that I could see because of the blinding light. He was standing in front of me and on each side were two smaller beings that I could not see because when I turned my head they moved it without touching me. They were putting what looked like a half of golf ball size to my side it had wires or coils hanging from it. They wouldn't let me look down. The tall bright one keep telling me by mind control ""that it is okay everything will be alright. You will remember or do you remember. Then my head was moved down to look at a scene I remember when I was 16 years old. I'm now 76. The scene was one of a place I used to go fishing when I was 16 at Keystone State Park in Pa.I could see the water ripplimg and blades of grass right in front of me. For years I told everyone back then that I was fishing and must have fallen asleep as I woke up clear on the other side of the Park. I remember walking back to my fishing spot and all my gear was there. It's puzzeled me for years. When I was in my 50's I had to have an x ray of my hand and the Doctor enquired to what was the thin piece of metal or whatever was in my finger. Since there was no scar he shrugged it off. Well now back to my tall stranger and two smaller ones. They had put something on my side and at the same time they were doing something to the same finger the Dr. had seen something in.To make it short I have pictures of the marks from my side and pictures of the scars on my finger. If we could talk it would make more scence. THIS IS A TRUE HAPPENING!!! I still break down and start crying for no reason.

MUFON,2018-10-19 12:00AM,10/22/18,,Plains,MT ,MONTANA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Stepped outside for a cigarette with the misses and looked up before blinding myself with the flash of my lighter. What I saw instantly stuck out as something very odd. We live under a busy flight path for both commercial and military aircraft. As I am constantly observing various craft and navigation lighting layouts I knew this was not the usual airplane helicopter or drone. It was about 130am well past the typical flight times when I looked up to see a dark non reflective craft with 2 solid red lights moving faster than a balloon but slower than a plane or helicopter. The craft bobbed up and down left and right in no particular pattern as it moved at a somewhat slow but steady pace. The best o can describe this movement is a flying bird flapping it's wings. The craft seemed to have trouble holding a steady flight vector and almost stumbled it's way across the sky about 500ft above our heads. As the craft passed over I noticed no sound at all and the 2 lights never blinked and we're steady for the duration of my observation. also as the craft passed the light furthest from us disappeared momentarily behind the body of the object but I was still unable to make out it's shape as it was dark in color and was not reflective. It was low enough but the only size reference was the distance between the 2 red lights which I'd say was about 20 feet. Both of us were left confused but did not want to jump to conclusions. Whatever it was I have never observed anything like it before.

MUFON,2020-11-11 8:30AM,3/19/21,,Burbank CA,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report My husband I and our 4 year old son went on a camping trip to New Mexico in October 1995. During the trip my husband pulled into a remote camping spot (remote but it had a concrete slab outdoor grill overhang shelter trashcan. We parked our truck there (truck had a camper shell we could sleep in.). We made made a fire in the grill our son played around (never leaving the spot we parked in) husband was startled while sitting by the fire by a huge animal ( or elk) that walked up very close then we turned in to sleep in the bed of the truck inside camper shell We fell asleep. Then at 1am I awoke. I know the time because I was wearing an Indiglo watch and looked at it when I awoke. I looked out the slats of a small window in the camper my son right next to me husband on the other side of him both sound asleep. Through the slats I saw a bright white light through the trees kind of in the distance but close enough to see three silhouettes. The light and figures came closer so I woke my husband and asked him to look also. He saw them but said ‘Oh it’s just ’. I pointed out that don’t carry lights and they were standing on two legs! He agreed. As we stared they kept getting closer. This is where it got frightening. At one point we could see them outlined very clearly. They stopped advancing toward us. I had shined a flashlight out at them to get s better look. Here is a description (this sight is burned in my memory and very clear!). There were three of them. Not sure how tall because trees were the only reference point. Not unusually tall or short. -shaped heads. The heads were not shaped like human heads. Arms were very long; the hands hung down by their knees and hands had three fingers each. The faces were indistinguishable so no detail. The striking features were the head shape long thin arms and three fingers. The light began to swing back and forth and they started walking toward our truck again. The light swung like a lantern I thought. But it got much brighter white then turned orange. It flashed white orange white orange and then they were VERY close. The light was super bright. I remember being so frightened and suddenly got very sleepy. I remember thinking ‘I’m so terrified but at least I’m falling asleep and won’t have to feel it anymore’. It was blissful like when you are about to go into surgery and the anesthesia hits suddenly. The next thing I remember was waking up in our truck camper at 11am. (Again I looked at my watch). As we rolled out of our camper to begin cleaning up our campsite to leave none of us recalled the weird night sighting before. Then two men rode up on horseback. I noticed right away they looked out of place. Having grown up in the rodeo and helping my dad ‘break’ wild horses and riding them for years I knew the gear the clothing the mannerisms etc. of riders. These two men were wearing what looked like felt vests brand new  the horses gear looked new and the men sat very straight up in the saddles. They looked like actors portraying guys on horseback. I smiled and in a typical friendly texas way said hi! They looked at me sternly and one of them said ‘ not many people come up here in this remote area. How was your evening?’ My husband answered it was fine the sky was beautiful at night we’re just packing to out of here. They never smiled acted very official and just said ‘good’. I thought the exchsnge was weird as country guys on horseback are always helpful and friendly. They left. We packed up drove down to a town called Mountainair and our truck suddenly died. Just as we hit town. Hubby walked over to a junkyard close by to use the phone (pre-cellphone era!). The guy there said oh youre in luck I’m also the . He looked at our vehicle said it would take maybe three days to get the part he needed and pointed us to a little motel we could stay at. After truck was fixed days later we headed out. It wasn’t until about ten years later I was sitting at a computer and suddenly the memory of the whole incident came back to me. We literally had no recollection all those years of what we had seen. I thought: hmmm that’s weird. I searched ‘Manzano Mountains aliens’ but we had never talked about seeing them or even remembered seeing them. This was my first encounter (during the search) with the word ‘Grays’. As I searched more I saw pictures of supposed ‘alien’ beings and was stunned to remember and realize those three figures looked just like what I was seeing in articles. I learned there was an underground base in the Manzano mountains (Red Canyon is in those mountains). I eventually read about ‘men in black’ who visit people the day after an encounter usually in twos. I wondered if that explained the two unfriendly guys on horseback who appeared the next morning and who did not seem dressed like real riders and whose demeanor was unusual also. My husband preferred to forget the whole incident but Once it came back in my memory I could not. This is the first time I’ve reported it other than to friends who would listen (but who likely didn’t believe or want to believe such a crazy story. Our son had no recollection of it. He slept the whole time. He did have a few strange occurences a few years later. He said he felt like someone was outside his window sometimes watching him. He also said he woke up upside down in bed sometimes and thought it was weird (his feet on the pillow where his head and been when he went sleep and his head at the foot of the bed. None of that seemed important though until I read years later about others having those things happen after an encounter. Hubby has (infrequently though) thrashed around in his sleep and screamed out (like terrified!) ‘help somebody help me!’) I just wonder in the back of my mind if we didn’t encounter real alien beings out there. No recollection at all of anything that happened after they approached our truck the blissful feeling of going to sleep suddenly and waking the next morning.

I used the vectoring technique. i thought it would take a long time for me to be able to call them in. it worked my first time and hasnt stopped since. it took me months to accept this. alot of stress. i plan on being hypnotized. ive had 2 daytime sightings one where my esophagus was healed. i had an endoscopy 5 days after my 1st daytime sighting and they kind of link into your head. i realized i was communicating with them so i asked them to heal me. my endoscopy showed brand new healing pink tissue. my doctor said he couldt explain it. i remember going home from the hospital shocked. i have before and after scans. my entire paradigm has been shattered even though i caused this. i realize i shouldnt play games with greers protocol but im seeing incredible stuff. its working for me. i have no idea why this is easy for me. i want to know whos onboard. i have to know. thinking i was abducted is difficult for me but something happened when that triangle was 50 feet over me. thanks. wendy Content-type: text/html,,Experience Lights in my house that I could feel heat and don't know the names too has color,beautiful,,"Wasilla,AK "
MUFON,2021-03-03 10:13AM,3/11/21,,Proctorville,OH ,OHIO,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report One foggy sunny morning in July 2019 I took a picture of my back yard because I thought it looked particularly beautiful that day I posted the photo to Instagram and thought nothing of it until an hour or so later when I checked my post and realized there was a strange object hovering in the sky just above the treetops in the picture. It looked long and slender with a rounded top but was in a location where there are no tall buildings or towers. I had even driven right under the area where it seemed to be hovering after taking the photo but hadn’t noticed anything. I showed it to a few family and friends who thought it was spooky but none of us could figure out what it was. Recently I showed the picture to some friends and they reminded me it was a Live Photo (when you press it you can see it move like a video). When I do that the object appears to flash into the photo extremely briefly which may be why I don’t remember seeing the object at all when I actually took the photo. I have no idea what it is just that I can’t explain it.

MUFON,2019-07-09 6:28AM,2/26/21,,Purcellville,VA ,VIRGINIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report On 2/21/2021 My wife and I were traveling Eastbound on On Naranja Drive in Oro Valley. It was a clear beautiful day with no clouds to be seen. I Observed a white cigar shaped high altitude object that was stationary in a northeast direction estimated about 20 - 30 miles away. I observed the object for around a 2 - 3 minutes. I tried to point it out to my wife but she was in the passenger seat and could not get a good view of it. I continued observation while driving until a small ridge obstructed my view. As I cleared the hill I could no longer see the object. This is the second strange object that I have seen in the area over the last month so after my first encounter I watch the skies. Of note the first object I observed was also on a Sunday around the same time except to the east and appeared more as a stationary bright light that would fade in and out and then it was gone. It also was at a higher altitude and some distance from my position. My wife also saw this bright light with the first encounter. I wasn't going to report this but I saw on the Phoenix news that an american airlines piolt had observed the same object on the same day I had validation of what I saw and that maybe some how I could validate his story.

MUFON,2021-02-26 6:19AM,2/26/21,,Chicago,IL ,ILLINOIS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report We were setting up our Sony a three camera to test Our first time doing a time lapse. With her iPhone we were recording to see the best direction. We were on top of a hill overlooking the ocean in Malibu. When we were zooming in and zooming out we realize there was a UFO so we were trying to adjust our iPhone and it just disappeared About three weeks ago I was Heading to my doctors around 5:39 pM and I noticed the sky was extremely beautiful with solid but pastel colors. It went from pink to purple and then orange with holes and sky blue in those holes. I thought that was just so amazing so I took a photo of the sky. When I was leaving I noticed in a distance thirst large illuminating lights almost like someone took a desk lamp and try to shown it through the clouds but I also saw two helicopters circling it and I thought that was bizarre. When I got home I saw on TMZ that someone in the exact same area spotted a UFO and took a photo of it. That photo it’s almost like what we saw today. What’s funny is Where we are if you cut through the mountains thousand oaks is right there. There’s also the Oxnard military base about 25 miles north of where we are.

MUFON,2021-02-25 6:42AM,2/25/21,,Torrington,CT ,CONNECTICUT,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was flying out of Charlotte N.C. on Dec 11 2020 @ 5:07 pm from a business trip. We had been in the air for a few mins and I noticed a beautiful sunset over the city so I decided to take pictures of it. I was looking at the city below and just snapped off a few pictures zooming in and out to get a better shot of the city and sunset together. I wasn't really paying attention to anything but getting both the sunset and city in the picture I guess. It wasn't till now (Feb 11th 2021) while going through my pictures looking for something else I came across the photos of the odd objects in a few pictures I had taken. I noticed faint purple-colored crescent moons in one of the pictures. I figured it was just lens flare or something else no big deal. As I continued to look through the other photos I could see the color and objects change place and were becoming more solid. There appeared to be light patterns forming around the middle of the circular objects that had now morphed into 3 separate circles- 1 big and 2 small. From the first photo they had gone from pale in color almost like half-moon looking to the last picture where they were very solid bright purple color. I also noticed there was something reflecting the glow above and below all 3 objects but I can't make out what they were. I am not saying these are UFO's frankly I don't know what they are. But I felt it was worth sending in for you to review what is in the pictures. I have had a few people look at them to get their opinion and they are baffled as I am. I didn't use a flash to take the pictures there wasn't any type of purple lights coming off the plane and I didn't really notice them when I was taking the pictures. As you will be able to tell when I zoomed in you couldn't see the objects it's only when I was zoomed out were visible. That leads to the conclusion they were above a certain vantage point and it wasn't a reflection from the camera otherwise it would have been noted in the other photos. Even in the first photo it looks like they were closer to the plane wing and in other photos either we had moved away from them or vice versa. But it's obvious there was a change in location distance shape transparency brightness and the # of objects. It was like the smaller one had morphed into 2 at one point. I am including all the photos I took at that time just to show the difference in placement of the objects in conjunction with the plane. Please let me know what these things are. It would be appreciated!

MUFON,2021-02-21 9:15AM,2/25/21,,Oro Valley,AZ ,ARIZONA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was coming home from work. I live in the mountains of north west South Carolina. Approximately 3 miles from my home near spy rock trail rd I could see light through the tree tops. I thought maybe we had another missing hiker and they had a helicopter searching. Then it came into view it was no helicopter. Maybe 100 feet from the road at tree top level was some kind of craft hovering. All I could see was a oval red light at what appeared to be the front and light bluish strip of light running down the side. It appeared to be 25 feet in length or more. About the time I got even with spyrock it took off. This thing went from a hover to the speed of a fighter jet in the blink of an eye! Two miles further up the road I turned off on Academy Rd where I live. In the daytime there is a beautiful view of the Georgia mountains. But at night it is completely dark. I glanced that direction out my driver window and slammed on my brakes. Around the nearest Georgia mountain was multiple orbs. Some white. Some with a reddish tint. Some of the larger white ones were stationary. But many were moving in erratic patterns. I watched for 10 minutes or more then drove on to see if I could see anything from my house but couldn’t. One thing I distinctly remember even as close as I was to the craft near spy rock trail rd there was no sound at all.

I worked in soft count. I was still new so I was parking on the top floor of the parking garage. I would get there early to sit in my car drink my coffee and enjoy the peace before I had to jump into the crowd below. There was know one on the top floor of the parking structure but me about a quarter to four I got out of my car I remember the weather was beautiful I was looking around at the stars since I was high above the lights of Vegas you could see them very well this is when I noticed the stars where being blocked out it looked like just over the casino I was looking east and up the stars were being blocked out over me and from side to side over to the next casinos I couldn’t see anything but black a lot ! Covering the stars I noticed it was moving west toward the mountains towards Pahrump it was moving very slow but steady I didn’t know what to think. I was trying to focus on what it could be and I saw a line of circles about ten they were in line in the direction it was moving it was very hard at first to see them they were the color of a black light the lights started moving around each other the one in the back would move to the left and go to the front and the light in front would move to the right and move in line in the center they started moving faster in and out of each other but staying in line. I was very interested in what it was I couldn’t take my eyes off of it I thought know one was going to believe me right then I took out my iPhone and started filming what I was seeing then I realized what the hell am I doing fear griped me and I hit the ground very scared now because I was alone and didn’t know what this was I was kneeling for a couple of minutes I got a grip on myself stood up and walked fast to the elevator I looked back as I got on I could see it was past the casino now and still moving slow towards the mountains. I was very upset I almost went back home. I told one of my coworkers and they made me feel like and idiot so I didn’t mention it again. This thing was huge and know one seemed to notice it but me.I looked at my phone as soon as I got home and it’s totally black if you look close you can see white spots moving but nothing else it’s not very good.

As i kept looking I fixated on this one ""star"" and noticed it was moving erratically in multiple different directions. I used actual stars surrounding it as a point of reference and it was in fact moving. I kept staring at it just observing its movement patterns for about a half hour until my neck started to hurt from looking upwards. I was trying to telepathically communicate to it saying ""If you can hear me show me a sign and move more erratically I'm peaceful but I need to know what is going on"". It seemed to move more as I talked to it however as it was as small as a star it was moving only within a good inch of the sky from where i was standing it didn't take off in any direction it just kept moving within that inch of the sky left right up down diagonal etc. I went back inside to tell my parents because I was in shock I have never actually seen a UFO before however I've always wanted to. First my mother came out to look and she and my father are both skeptics however she saw it moving just the same as I did. Then she went back inside and my father came out who is more of a skeptic than she and he confirmed the same thing. I kept staring at it just trying to observe its motions and again it must have been EXTREMELY high up in the sky. At one point i saw it ""shoot out"" multiple much smaller lights that were buzzing around it in a larger radius. These lights were much brighter not orange. They looked more like stars do. These much smaller lights were not apparent the entire time like the larger one was they would disappear then reappear again randomly in various locations. I then left to go back to my roommates house and as i was pulling out of my drive way I called my roommate William (or Ben) and told him everything I saw i was shaken at this point and was super excited. I told him the exact location of where to look ( to the right of the constellation Orion and SouthWest of the little dipper and to the left of two other vertical stars). He and my other roommate Frank went outside to look where I told them and as I was driving William texted me that he saw them too plural he apparently saw more of them than I did and actually in a slightly different location than I described.

Then it took off at a 45 degree angle and disappeared-becoming the size of a speck of sand in a fraction of a second. Extraordinary. Beautiful. Was proud to have witnessed this wonder! Just want to know if by chance we went up. My sister believed it took a long time to arrive home.

Several days later while reviewing all my photos I noticed a white speck against the blue sky so I zoomed in. It was a rectangle. I showed it to my husband and asked if he knew what it was. He just said ""It's a rectangle it's not a plane."" When I asked what a rectangle was doing in the sky he had no answer. I've shown picture to about 10 people who all agree this is not a plane.

MUFON,2021-01-19 6:39PM,1/20/21,,Stull,KS ,KANSAS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report It was sometime after 7 pm MST a few days after Christmas. I was out walking my dog in my neighborhood in Scottsdale AZ and enjoying the beautifully clear skies of Arizona. Stargazing as usual when out of the corner of my eye in the SW of me was a triangle pattern of 3 lights moving as one. I immediately wondered if I was looking at 3 crafts or 1. It was pretty high in the sky at about 75 degrees and it moved slowly in a westwardly direction forward and then down and then backwards. It swooped around in a circular pattern more forwardly. The 3 lights combined were very high and maybe to me together the size in between a baseball and a softball. It continued on westward and I watched as it passed over a large star or planet. I expected to see the star in between the lights but that's when I noticed the star disappear behind it and reappear as it passed over. The lights began pulsating soon after and the craft began spinning slowly. Then the lights merged into one single light got brighter and then zoomed away getting smaller and smaller until nothing. I of course did not have my cell phone on me as the walk was only meant to be a quick pee break for my dog so sadly I have no footage but I know what I saw. Hope someone else saw something similar as it was in the city. Content-type: text/html,,While observing the ISS,beautiful,trim.F2F76665096448E3AC831B44A7015906.MOV,"Stull,KS "

On December 22 2020 just before 0630hrs I noticed that the clouds and moved out and the sky was clear so I went outside to see if I could see the Christmas star Saturn and Jupiter. When I look to the west I noticed a very bright light off in the distance below the telephone wires it looked oblong like two planets on top of each other it was beautiful. Then I noticed it moved above the telephone wire and was coming straight east. It then turned and proceeded northeast that's when I noticed it looked more like a cylinder tilted on an angle. As it moved further northeast it then disappeared. That's when I noticed higher in the sky moving west to east in a straight line at a steady pace a white dot.

I occasionally looked out the window the first 30 mins of the flight until I fell asleep. About an hour and a half in I wake and see the beautiful stars but noticed one was lower than the rest. I kept my eyes on the Star-like object and noticed it was moving almost back and forth then to my surprise it began changing from white to other beautiful colors. (Reddish/orange Bluish/green&purple) This went on for 2 hours which ended my flight and as we're landing in illinois I can still see it in the air.

MUFON,2020-12-27 7:00PM,1/7/21,,Scottsdale,AZ ,ARIZONA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I turned onto fairground rd and it was there. It was slightly passed the end of thomas hollow rd. I stopped in the road and just looked at it.it was so close it was huge gold in color imagine from the very bottom upwards a small circle a medium circle then a bigger circle sitting on top of eachother then what looked like a roofs edge going all around it then a medium circle with rounded off but squared dark blackish windows then a smaller circle and a flattened off top. Thats about when i started to get scared a liitle then heard in my brain do not be afraid. My fear left within a second and i was just looking at it. It was so close and huge i could feel a static like charge in the air the radio kinda started to get staticie and the hairs on my arms and back of neck just all over stood up. I just sat there in my car and looked at it for about a 2 minutes or so... I was mesmerized.... Then my passenger got scared as the static rose in intensity and he said go go away from it... So i turned onto thomas hollow rd. Then changed my mind i wanted to watch it leave so i pulled into my driveway the 2nd driveway on the road... and jumped out of the car looked over but it was gone. Completely gone just that fast! I could see where it was perfectly but it was gone. No trail no exhaust no nothing at all... Like it was never there to begin with. I will never forget this experience. It was beautiful i was not afraid i feel lucky to have seen it all so close and detailed and in the middle of the day right infront of my eyes. There is no denying of what it was or could have been... It was so close and plain as day it was ufo. Now... Man maid or alien im not sure but i dont understand how a man could broadcast into my brain do not be afraid. So... I dont know. My whole entire life changed that day. My thoughts and opinions will always be of an open mind. I know what i saw. I hope everyone can someday see what i seen it truly leaves no room to doubt.

MUFON,2020-12-22 6:30AM,1/1/21,,Chicago,IL ,ILLINOIS,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report I was just south from the Montana Canadian Border at a very remote location. My wife and I stepped out for a smoke at about 1:00 in the morning. I like to carry my Green laser pointer just cause its fun to play with at night. We were staying the night at a friend's on the Blackfoot Indian Reservation. I was gazing at the clear crisp beautiful night sky when I noticed or it looked like one of the stars was very bright. Then I noticed it was moving very slow I also realized it now seemed very close. Not as in it moved but as in my depth perception tuned in. Wow I thought. What.....in....the.....heck! I shined my green lazer at it I guess out of instinct I don't really know why. It immediately turned off its powerfull white and yellow light and turned bright red. This was extremely scary to me I mean it freaked me out to the very core. Anyway as soon as ot changed colors it shot what looked like straight out into space with a at a speed and acceleration that would kill a man I should think due to the g force alone. When it stopped I noticed the second one. It was the same color. The danced around each other for maybe 5 minutes. Then one of them came tumbling back toward me in a cork screw maneuver while the other one slowly decended to the north east over the Canadian border and towards Waterton national park. The one coming back towards me just kept corkscrews and dancing above me in the night sky. This is about when I grabbed my wife to come smoke and look at it with me. She also saw it and didn't understand what we were seeing. Eventually it slowly floated over the Canadian border and out of sight. The was zero noise which may have been the most frightening part. The craft was not 30 000 feet I knew that because I often watch commercial jets at night. I also watch fighter jets and recognize their altitudes and abilities. This craft was low slow powerfully and had no noise. I estimate no higher than 10000 feet and no lower than 7000 feet. If it had any sort of conventional engine I know I would of heard at least something. It was clear and bright out and dead quiet that night. I have no evidence except my word. I hope that holds some value. I have nothing to gain I do however want to know so badly what ""these"" things are. I know maelstrom is not far from where I was at and I know they have seen things before. I have also read of a trapper in the 1800s who saw something crash and it cut a swath in the trees and he followed it to find symbols on it but I don't know if thats reliable or true? Anyway again I don't scare easy. I'm very intelligent and what I saw deeply disturbed me. I don't know how to describe it it was crazy.

I ran in my apartment to get my phone and decided to video it and as I watched it I could see it turn to different shapes and brilliant colors very rapidly!!. Some were made of two colors like a surge of energy inside of the shape? It did have sparks of energy coming off from it but you had to look very closely. One shape was a sphere and would turn in a circular motion then to a square (stopped) then to a diamond to a triangle Ect. It was amazing and beautiful to watch but I had no idea to what I was witnessing here? I videoed it for I guess 30 to 40 minutes. It got smaller as it went to the East.

I was going home driving eastbound and I looked to the north east and saw bright lights on a sunny day facing westbound. It was the size of a football field at least. This object was hovering over a barn on 200 North in Greenfield . I then turned to the south and it went invisible in the sky but I could still see a shadow behind it. After getting home I went to a trail in town and by this time I was one mile south but directly across from where I saw it before. So I looked I. The sky and it came back into view again. This time I saw white and then it looked like it. Hanged a shape cause then I saw what looked like dark glass windows or mercury but only vertical. It just faded into the sky went invisible.

MUFON,2020-08-04 1:30AM,12/17/20,,Babb,MT ,MONTANA,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report Out in my back yard in Valencia Ca. I felt a compression or a change in atmosphere. The air felt heavy like pressure. I was looking at the stars as I liked to do out in the spa. My gaze shifted focus when I felt the pressure like a wind but more of a vaccume effect. Out of nowhere on a still night. My memory is somewhat fragmented because if panic or stress but there suddenly was a huge black triangle of ""sky"" falling out of the sky with a mist of grey or dark smoke like it was burning the sky as it descended. It came to rest about 30 ft over the townhomes to my left the west. I couldn't comprehend what I was seeing. It leveled out and hovered slowly moving forward over me and my house it was absolutely gigantic like two or three football fields in size! It floated back more over the corner of my house and I could see under it. It was so black like the absence of light non reflective like it was covered in worn tire rubber. There were lights (1) at each corner that looked more like vents for a glowing red yellow and white flame burner that flickerd in an illusory wave pattern. (My best description) . Hovering there as it slowly crossed over me I felt it do close like I could have touched it. It was silent only a strange electrical static feeling and initially a pressure wave. It turned toward the north east mountains and slowly headed off and up. It gained speed quickly and then began to disappear in a heat wave like you see the watery look of over a hot road or in the dessert. Like a mirage cloaked it. Then it was just gone. I wa yelling for my husband to come outside but he missed the whole thing. I don't know if anyone else's anything but I never heard anyone talk about anything like that. I never said anything except to my family. Not for fear but more of the fact that I also seem to have about a half hour of time missing and fractured memories of also seeing it wayyy up high in the sky and turning over my house in a separate direction. But those memories only came to me after a series of dreams and I cannot tell what was real or as I say an inky part of a dream. What I'm describing is to the best of my knowledge what happened in sequence. I was shook out of my wits with excitement and terror. About a year later around the same time of year early fall but about 2-2:30 am I was upstairs in the bathroom. The small window was open and I was looking out over the planted greenbelt when a large basketball size orb / round ball of extremely beautiful colorful light was spinning at extraordinary speed around a light pole over the high school football field light across the street just past the greenbelt in a tight spiral up and down the pole. When I I saw it I said out loud ""no way!"" It was as if it heard me because it immediately stopped spinning and jutted out about 10 ft from the pole then dropped out if sight straight down with a flash of light trailing it. I waited up nearly the whole rest if the night waiting to see more but never did. Out of these two events I think the most amazing part is that I seem to be the only one who saw anything.

I’m an avid stargazer and like to see what constellations I know. As I was looking up I saw a bright line of white lights on a diagonal. I thought they were stars at first but couldn’t figure out the constellation. Also I have never seen stars so close together or so bright. Then I thought maybe it’s Christmas lights on someone’s barn but I realized they were way too high off of the ground to be on a building. I saw the lights brighten and flicker and I noticed a domed outline against the sky that was blocking stars. I rolled the window down and stuck my head out to get a better look and to be sure it wasn’t some reflection on my windshield. The lights appeared to disappear one by one upward as if they were rotating away. Then what was there was gone and I could see the stars again.

MUFON,2008-09-18 11:00PM,12/10/20,,Valencia,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was on a walk north on Marion with a beautiful clear night sky above. Saw a very large object ascend above the trees and houses from the NW. It moved absolutely silently over Marion road and swept on a continuous path to the SE. It appeared to be very large and about 0.5 mi to 1.0 mi away from me not quite overhead. It was shaped like a rounded less angular boomerang. It had many small randomly positioned white lights not bright. The effect of the lights caused the ufo to resemble delicate lace at times with the body of the object seemingly invisible. The object moved to the SE and I tried to see its silhouette in the brighter sky in that direction but it had disappeared. The whole sighting lasted about 10 to 12 seconds.

MUFON,2020-12-03 8:00PM,12/6/20,,Huntington,IN ,INDIANA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Looking west across the ocean towards the setting sun the island of Lanai is directly across the water. There were some clouds sort of sitting there right at Lanai’s peak but the rest of the sky was totally clear minus some very light stratus clouds. For the last roughly 20 minutes of the sunset before the sun crossed the horizon line the sun itself was blocked from my point of view. by the island of lanai leaving a beautiful palate of colors in the sky. It was during this time after the sun had passed behind Lanai but before completely setting that I had my sighting. Looking out at sky above and around Lanai (from the water right next to Black Rock on Kanapali Beach) just to the right of the island I saw some solid completely motionless object. It’s hard to estimate altitude and distance but I would say it was roughly a 30 degree angle from my vantage point and roughly about as high up as Lanai if not slightly lower and if I pointed one hand directly to the north edge of Lanai and my other hand directly at the object they would be roughly 2 feet apart (hope that makes sense) Whatever was in the sky was glowing and resembled the sun reflecting off a big sheet of gold or copper in the sky but the sun was setting behind it so I don’t see how from my POV it could have been any kind of reflection. It’s also hard to estimate the shape of the object although it kind of looked like a soda can or something (the light coming off of it and distance made it really hard to judge the shape just what comes to mind). I observed it sitting completely still for et least 45 seconds and then it just dissapeared or phased out. It didn’t shoot off it was just there one second and then gone the next leaving nothing but clear sky behind. ***foot note. I have no idea if this is relevant or not but a few nights before I went to the top of Haleakala by myself at about 1 am and spent about 3 hours up there totally alone without seeing another person or car the whole time. It was an almost full moon so there weren’t a lot of stars but I thought I would try at least what I remembered to be the basics of [removed name/cms/fgc] CE-5 protocols. Meditated on and off for a good hour tried to put a lot of intention into it and aside from a couple shooting stars didn’t see anything. On the night of my sighting as the sun was setting and I started to see some stars I toyed with the idea again but only tried to put my “intention” out for about 60 seconds or so... didn’t even really mediate but about 10 minutes later is when I had my sighting. This probably had nothing to do with it but thought it was worth mentioning Content-type: text/html,,Large hovering UFO seen on way home,beautiful,,"Huntington,IN "

Right overhead a brighter than normal moving light. No flashing wing lights. I made a joke oh look a UFO! We stopped and watched it proceed to the south when off to the east of it at 90 degrees another white light of the same size closed in on its position. They slowed and merged into one unit.

We must have been a bit outside of Asheville in the mountains near Chimney rock on the highway. There was several other cars on the road. It was mid-day and extremely bright and beautiful out. While driving a highly reflective object in the sky glinted in my eyes several times and I looked up to see a very large capsule/cigar shaped crafter floating just below the cloud line. At first thinking it was a plane (although a large one) we continued to observe it was we drove. The longer we watched the stranger it seemed. It had no wings distinguishable nor a tail Rutter. The specular reflection bouncing off the top was extremely bright and sharp which further accentuated that it had no features (wings tail etc). The specular reflection made it clear that it was the capsule/cigar shape. My girlfriend was able to observe more and was completely taken aback at how round and sleek it was. it was hard to tell if it was a disk shape given our angle and distance. It was rather hard to capture in video with the same clarity which we saw it. Shortly after my girlfriend started taking the video it almost ""wipe-faded"" to the same color as the dark bottom of the cloud or moved into the cloud. It was hard to distinguish a sense of movement from the object before that. It seemed to be fixed in the sky and the only movement was from us winding around on the highway as we drove.

MUFON,2020-11-02 6:05PM,11/13/20,,Lahaina,HI ,HAWAII,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report At about 10pm on November 6th 2020 I was standing on my back porch with my wife when we observed over the course of approx 15 second a glowing ball streak across the sky at anywhere from 500 ft to 1500 ft in the air and then just disappeared. Due to the fact that the weather had changed from being in the 30s to the 60s within 24 hours I assumed what I saw was most likely ball lighting. I ruled out right away a shooting star because I have literally seen hundreds if not thousands of shooting stars in my life and it did not have any similarities at all with the exception of its straight flight pattern. We shrugged it off as really beautiful and awesome but was what we thought was definitely a natural phenomenon. 3 hours later I am on that same back porch and I observe the exact same thing in the sky that probably lasted about 8 seconds. It made no sound of any kind and again just disappeared. It did not burn up or land. I stood frozen in place for probably around 1-2 minutes in disbelief of what I had just witnessed. It took me several hours after that to calm down would probably be the best way of describing it. I did develop a migraine headache which lasted the majority of the next day. I do suffer from migraines from many concussions during my athletic college career but had not had one in almost a month. Not sure what that says about the sighting but thought I would include it in my description. I have no other proof which was why I was not going to say a word about it. The only reason I am reporting it was to see if anyone else saw what I saw at either time. To be honest I am not going to tell or talk about it to anyone with the exception of my wife as she saw the 1st sighting with me. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

MUFON,2020-11-06 10:05PM,11/7/20,,South Portland,ME ,MAINE,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report UFO SIGHTING Described below is something so bizarre that I want to share it. Someone else may have had a similar experience and kept it to themselves. On the Fourth of July 2017 in northern Indianapolis about 1 p.m. I saw something I cannot explain. I walked into my large backyard and happened to glance up. Small dense white clouds were traveling in a northeastern direction under a beautiful blue sky. I was watching them when I noticed that one very large cloud to the near northwest the exact same color as the rest was stationary. That big cloud was gently moving like slowly bubbling or percolating in place while the smaller clouds traveled northward above below and beside it. Then I saw something I wasn’t prepared to see. The big cloud was mostly concealing an enormous craft. From my viewpoint the overall effect resembled the nose of a cruise ship peeking out of a cloud. The craft’s skin was smooth with no external appendages. Its color was a pale washed-out non-reflective gray. There was no sound. The part of the craft I could observe looked like a 3-layer cake. I made a drawing of it from memory. The top tier was the smallest and had no openings. The second level was deeper and wider rounded on the end and had about four black vertically rectangular openings or windows that were a bit wider at the bottom. The rest of them were masked by the cloud. The third layer was wider still and had no openings that I could see. The bottom of this level and whatever was below it was concealed by the cloud. The craft was close by and immense. Judging from what I was able to see it must have been hundreds of feet across. I went back into the house to find my wife (and the camera only she knew how to operate). She was grocery shopping. I came out again about five minutes later and the thing was still there. I returned to the house and came out about twenty minutes later. It was gone. I didn’t take UFOs seriously until I saw one and then waited three years before I told anyone except my wife. The event didn’t much affect me at the time. Now I think of it often and find myself watching clouds more closely. What I probably saw was the left edge of a “flying saucer” that closely resembles some of the drawings on Google Images.

MUFON,2020-09-25 9:00PM,11/4/20,,Melbourne,FL ,FLORIDA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was on vacation in Florida around Venice Beach. The weather was beautiful I was filming birds on the pier taking off and capturing them in super slow motion with my Galaxy S10 plus. I was basically just sightseeing and trying to capture some really beautiful photography because that area is beautiful. About a year later I was going through my videos and checking them over and I noticed at one point there was a black dot that appeared and disappeared above the bird on the left side. Upon further inspection I was completely surprised to see what is actually captured in super slow motion and actually at regular speed as well. When you use super slow motion in the camera mode on the Galaxy S10 plus it always starts out full speed after about a second and then it goes into super slow motion. when the craft came in from the far right far away zoomed in at normal speed for one second you can't really see it with a naked eye. But if you freeze a frame and zoom in you can see that it's been captured many times because the camera obviously takes multiple pictures per second. so then when the camera switched to super slow motion almost exactly at that instant this thing cut right and then the in super slow motion it started to blur away. That is very interesting because when it went to super slow motion it was taking off in slow motion but blurring away which means it must be traveling at such a high rate of speed that it's hard for me to calculate. Anyways I have the video posted at RSGiving on YouTube for anybody that would like to see it. The video is copywritten and the rights were given to my son. I haven't yet scoured anymore of my slow motion videos that I took in Florida over the course of two weeks but now I'm kind of interested in seeing if I caught anything else. I took a lot of 360 degree video footage with my gear 360 as well. But I did not have it set up and running when I took a picture of this one bird. I was using my Galaxy S10 plus. There's a lot of naysayers out there and I guess that's to be accepted. It's not doctored or anything like that it's simply is what it is. But it is fascinating when you really investigate the clip and look at it close up.

MUFON,2015-09-01 1:00AM,11/1/20,,Dunedin,FL ,FLORIDA,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report Sept. 30 2020 It was about 6:30pm dusk a beautiful orange sunset. I was looking out our picture window enjoying the sunset when I saw a ""star"". It struck me as unusual as it was quite dim and I was surprised that I could see it that well when the sky was not yet dark. The ""star"" was white and stationary and seemed to be a normal star at first. As it got darker I glanced at it off and on several times over a two hour period. It did not move at all as other heavenly bodies did. Then the object seemed to grow and began to get brighter much brighter. In fact about 20% brighter. Then it suddenly ""took off"" in a north to northwest direction. It was moving very fast. Faster than any plane I am aware of then it disappeared. I heard no sound at all. However this was quite a distance from me and I may not have heard anything if there was any sound. The sky was clear there were no clouds and no wind. The original sighting was approximately 10 degrees above the further mountain range. (see photos) Content-type: text/html",,elongated triangle,beautiful,,"Dunedin,FL "

I noticed a couple strange lights appear out of no where next thing I know there were 5 or 6 strange looking shaped lights that appeared I snapped another pic and the next thing I know they were gone and then the only thing in the sky was the bright full moon again. At the time of taking the pictures there were no stars in the sky it was just the bright full moon. I have no idea what the objects were or where they came from or where the disappeared to they were only visible for a couple minutes then they were gone!

MUFON,2020-09-30 6:30PM,10/5/20,,Sandpoint,ID ,IDAHO,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report There were three witnesses but I don't know their perspective nor have I spoken to anyone (other than posts) about my encounter. The being I saw is so beautiful and glow everywhere the whole atmosphere around me changed and time seem to stand still. Everything about the being is so perfect. You can visualize for yourself when you think of photoshop photos only this being was right in front of my very eyes. I was filled with just love and happiness that the being was my only focus everything around me disappeared. After the encounter that same day I had losted time and was in this intoxicated kind of state so much so that I don't really remember how the day ended or ever going to bed. I do get visits and lessons from the being and when I am quiet and still I see something like a heatwave hovering near me. I do have a picture of one encounter but I don't want to share it because I promised that I wouldn't. (this being can't be attacked physically it's just very sensitive and can feel on a whole different level than we). I now have a homesickness and loneliness about me that I just want to go home and I do hear the being speaking telepathically to me on a daily basis saying ""I will see you soon"" ""Everything is alright Christina "" I love you Christina "" Christina you have to wait for me."" I know the being's name but I literally can't get it off my tongue. Sometimes I wake up with the strong feeling that I was with this being but it's vague I also think I have a child(ren) in another dimension because one night I woke up and my arms were positioned as if I was holding a baby or small child I remember feeling very motherly. I also see light balls all the time but I am not scared ever. I sometimes see fast shadows but since my encounter with the beautiful being I don't get scared anymore. This being is with me all the time and is helping me write this and gives me information about current events (more insight). There is so much that I want to say but it's a very sensitive matter and my main goal is to protect the being. I know this being has power because things around me is so much clearer. I have researched and found others have had similar encounters but for some reason it's not as publicized as others. I know we are not alone and telepathically this being without speaking told me how to become like it which I am in the process of doing I can't evolve to my higher-self until I complete these steps. One day when I used to work I felt a shift in the atmosphere and everything seemed weird along with the people at my workplace everyone seemed to stare at me everything around me felt lighter and everything was just off the people at my job seem to talk strangely. One night when my shift ended I got up to clock out and the whole office was empty except for my supervisor who just stared out me neither one of us said anything to one another Since I am used to these types of events I just clocked out and thought about it on my way home. Now that I am ready to learn is when the being speaks to me and lets me know what happened. I really don't need to be told what it's about now like I did in the past because I have been given proof that my encounter is real because I am bonded with this being on a daily basis. As far as communicating with others I don't because no one understands and I have come to learn that conflict with others delays my evolution process. Because of what this being showed me I know that my human form is not a set in stone type of deal at all as well as other human beings. I have had beautiful outer body experiences with this being as my guide. I know now that once these beings contact you the learning process begins and that the beings bond to you and answers the question that No we are NOT alone. If it were not for these beings we would not have the technology that we have or anything for that matter. I also know that planet earth's government knows and will not divulge information because human society is not in it's right mind frame considering how we react to things concerning our our own planet e.g. racism violence hatred conflict etc. We have to be at a certain level mentally to even begin the learning process of things beyond our imagination. Planet earth and everything on it is a replica of the real dimension there is no pollution violence hatred wars etc. I have learned that planet earth's government is a replica of the government in the real dimension. Everything is just more beautiful on a whole other level. Just like this planet's government you have to have certain clearance before you can get certain information now I know everything is connected... I also want to say that the human body is very limited and our form comes from them you can say that our form is a lower grade because these beings are so beautiful and they glow I can't look at myself in the mirror anymore...We have to be on a certain mental level before we can even communicate because it's telepathic and the mid has to be on a certain frequency which is why our lifestyles has to be devoid of superficiality. I used to ignore other phenomenons but since being taught by this being I know that every type of information is important. I am much more quieter as well because if my mind is cluttered I feel a loneliness or yearning like I will be left behind or abandoned but instantly when I become quiet I hear the voice say you're okay Christina."" and I breath a sigh of relief I feel the feeling of abandonment daily sometimes because as a human being I do mess up all the time but the being also patiently tells me everything is okay. The being is also very involved in politics and what's going on in the world and can manifest itself to others anytime that person is ready to evolve. Our own minds imprisons us and if the mind doesn't evolve then it's imprisoned even if not behind prison bars. There's a type of Influence on another level that doesn't have to be over the internet television over the phone etc (our ways of communication is primitive). The influence that impacts society is the type that is done telepathically and with great emotion whether good or bad. There are those who have abilities and they are those that are not seen they can put fronts out and put names to those fronts. I understand this procedure now because of what I am experiencing. When one works under a government there is a great responsibility especially when communicating with society if negative influence is put out in society then society will act as such if positive influence is put out in society then society will act as such the reason being that human beings doesn't as of yet understand that we can receive message directed to the human subconscious. So what government one is under is very important if one claims to be a spokesperson for that government. More better than adults children can evolve more quickly if taught the right way because their minds are fresher and less cluttered with information. Those with mental disabilities also can detect other entities because their minds are ""unstabled."" The weaker the human brain the easier it easy to detect other dimensions or beings. It's true that a weak body has a stronger mind we rely too much on the physical body and it delays evolution. Since we all have a being embedded in our core mind one can help activate the other just by being having a positive opened mind and the process keeps going It's how I became activated. The implants that are pulled out of people with alien encounters are generic because the real implants are telepathic devices but the generic implants can be an example of the real implants but just on a positive level. Implants are a GPS which is why I am always able to be located no matter where I am. The mind is a computer and can be accessed like a computer and we should not hand over access to it from just any random person or being. We will know when a being is one of us because everything takes place properly and peacefully. Description: The main being was the focus but telepathically I saw others round the being's head is the best way I can describe it. The main being is very very very tall and thin. Once I made eye contact is when the being began to glow or shine. I don't remember date...year maybe was 2016 or 17. I don't know distance...

MUFON,2020-06-15 7:00PM,9/25/20,,West Columbia,SC ,SOUTH CAROLINA,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report During the Spring of 2015 while living in Brownfield Maine on a ideal Spring day (blue bird skies snow melting about 55 degrees) while working to break my travel-trailer out from the winter's ice I heard a Military fighter jet ""screaming"" in. When I looked up to try to identify it through the clearing of my driveway I observed a silver disc-like object shining from the sun's reflection directly above me. I remember saying to myself something like ""what is that weird thing"" as I continued to stare up at it. It was above 500' but below a mile stationary as if hovering directly above me. As the jet came in from the North the object as if becoming aware it had been detected darted upward very erratically. First slightly to the left then slightly to the right in bursts. Slowing down each time as if the propulsion system was not constant before releasing another burst of white cloud and accelerating again. It appeared to me to be a type of evasive maneuver more than a primary method of movement. In about 3-4 bursts it was out of sight essentially going straight up. Each time it changed direction another white cloud ejected from it. The UFO went out of sight into the clear blue sky just before the jet arrived a few seconds later. The whole observation lasted about a minute. The jet itself performed it's own impressive maneuver. Amazingly it appeared to almost stop in mid-air directly at the location the UFO formerly was and in an instant it turned 90 degrees vertically and went straight up after it. The maneuver was by no means an arch more like the plane flew directly to the known location and then turned up to track it. The plane seemed to turn ""on a dime."" I remember feeling somewhat serene and euphoric that morning. At the time I was attributing it to the absolutely beautiful Spring weather. After the experience I muttered to myself ""someone is pissed at that thing "" and I then happily went back to my work not thinking much of it. It was only until the next day when I woke up that I thought to myself ""I saw a UFO yesterday."" So that is my true-life UFO story.

MUFON,2017-08-03 9:00PM,9/24/20,,El Centro,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was driving on a beautiful summer day. At 12;30 PM on a highway. I observed what I originally thought was a plastic bag appear over the tree line in the top right corner of my car windshield. I could not tell the size of the object but it caught my eye. I was a circle and I thought it was a bag at first. However it moved in a perfectly straight line and at a steady rate of speed. About 1/2 way across my windshield the circular object turned quickly and became flat like a Frisbee. That the best way I can describe it. The object continued at the same rate of speed and at the same altitude for another 15 seconds. I watched it go from North to South (right to left across my field of visiion) until i lost sight of it in background cloud cover. I did not see any lights or color other than white. After I lost sight of the object I saw a helicopter fly in the opposite direction at what appeared to be the same attitude. I wish I had another passenger with me to confirm what I witnessed.

MUFON,2016-10-16 12:00AM,9/22/20,,#VALUE!,KS ,KANSAS,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report My girlfriend and I went to a new spot called The Point (Which is really The Pier a new version that took our city 5 years to build. it is one of our oldest attractions dating back to the 1900's in [location removed] . On our way too the point we both saw that about 2 miles away our city had dedicated 2 bright spotlights into the sky to represent the 9/11 attacks. They were beautiful but both of us were able to see from the spotlight on the ground clear to the top of the light (where the lights reached the overcasting clouds and stopped). By the time we made it to The Point (about 500-600 Yards off shore via a walk on the bridge) we could see the 9/11 lights clearly and the overcast had pretty much vanished. We both clearly saw the lights in the distance and there was nothing around them. WELL.. Then it got strange. I felt the sudden urge to go all the way across the top floor of The Point (about 100 feet from where our drinks were) before we left and take a picture of the 9/11 lights. Yet for some reason I couldn't get a good shot at all (so I thought). I kept noticing my phone screen was not taking my finger on the shutter button. So I gave up. Then we began walking back towards shore on the bridge you see in the photo attached. After about 100 yards I looked up towards the 9/11 lights and saw what looked like rips in the darkness. 3 almost portal-like orbs surrounding the 9/11 lights. My girlfriend has been on her way into the journey of ascending in consciousness and is in the begining stages just beginning to notice things. I didn't want to freak her out as I have had many many visits with ET Craft so I didn't point them out.. and then RIGHT after i decided not to they literally morphed into ONE amazingly massive ball of ""light"" and took off from the 9/11 light area clear passed where we were which is still miles away from the 9/11 lights at unimaginable speeds and into the sky in movements and speeds that defy any modern physics. I knew this wasn't the 9/11 lights being moved or changed because the 9/11 lights never moved during the entire duration of the event. I could see both 9/11 tower lights AND these orbs morph into one and fly off the entire time AND SO COULD MY GIRLFRIEND! We both were obviously happy but we weren't overjoyed or shocked. It was like we knew they were there the entire time. My girlfriend (her first encounter) literally going ""That was beautiful.."". Now of course anyone who's had an experience like this tries to discredit it in their mind. Well I did too until I went to upload a photo from the night (having nothing to do with the encounter).. and then I saw it. The 3 orbs were there while I was on the top floor of The Point/Pier I simply could not see them through the naked eye. Perhaps they weren't trying to be seen at the time. But when they left I saw them. When they morphed I saw them. Dozens of people were around us but with the music and events around it was as if no one else noticed. Like they wanted to send US a message. Attached is the photo I took about 15 minutes before the orbs morphed and what is funny is that when I was trying to take this photo my girlfriend had been talking about how she feels herself becoming enlightened conscious things of that nature.. Looking at the photo if you look at the bridge about half way down it is where we were when these lights became one and flew maybe 100-300 feet over our head but was so fast we couldn't possibly tell the speed. Sure enough as we got closer to the 9/11 beams and I took a second photo there was no more 3 orbs. This was without a doubt an intelligent life. Photo 1: A photo i took when i first noticed the 9/11 lights on the way to our destination The Point (where we would see the orbs) - directly west of where we would be located when i took photo 3 (the photo i later discovered captured the orbs we saw but not until after the event happened would i notice it captured them) Photo 2: The image that captured the orbs while my phone was messing up again I didn't get to view this photo until after the event occurred Photo 3: A photo from the parking lot after the event (parking lot is half way down the bridge on the left side if you're facing the skyline of [location removed]) to confirm to myself there was nothing there any longer.

There was a large sphere of light above the trees. Its size was slightly smaller than a full moon. There were points of bright white light on it and I could see some streaming light off these points. I thought it might be a supernova or the space station? In the yard I could see it above trees. Hard to estimate distance. It was a glowing sphere. I have seen Venus when it seems close to the trees. This was larger. It was very beautiful. It may have risen in the sky but I couldn't see the motion. Another person in the house saw it also thought it might be a drone? Satellite? When sunrise occurred I could no longer see it. I was staring at it and to me it appeared like wings which a bird raises straight up. There was a little gap at the top. Yet it was a sphere.

However we quickly noticed lights flashing very rapidly. The object looked like it had the color of the sun both on top and bottom. The object was roating counter clockwise. It had a beautiful array of light's roating at very high speed around the object. I ran in the house got my clestron 114lcm telescope. I have very good opticis with a 3x barrlow lens.

We were at the newer Maya Theater Plaza Center near Fresno State University. It was blue hour a clear beautiful evening As we were coming out of the Yogurt shop I looked to the Eastern Sky between the two tall Palm Trees I saw this large silent squarish / rectangular shaped object it was hovering for some time then very slowly gliding to the North. It emitted it's own lights. It looked like it had four lights one on each of its corners that looked round. It was casting a very bright yet soft glowing light that surrounded it. It was silent. I nudged my husband and said ""Do you see that in the sky over there?"" He looked quickly and said ""No"" I have no idea if he really saw it or not or if he was just carried away talking and laughing with our friends. None of them saw it as I pointed it to them.

MUFON,2020-08-30 10:45PM,8/31/20,,conway,AR ,ARKANSAS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Multiple reflective vehicles 'floating' over/behind buildings in a downtown Brickell neighborhood in Miami FL in the middle of a bright clear sunny day. Observer was looking approximately 40 - 45 degrees up from a 7th floor building balcony straight north. A group of small uncommon flying vehicles with no notable exhaust plume no noise and no wings were floating slowly in unison due west as they began reflecting sunlight beautifully and individually lighting up a random pattern among their small group. As the reflections disappeared the craft would 'disappear' into the bright blue sky no longer visible. Craft would then reflect light again in a similar random pattern a few seconds later thus becoming visible once more again only for a few seconds before disappearing until the group had all flown away and permanently out of view.

MUFON,2017-07-09 8:55PM,8/24/20,,Fresno,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was at dodge park for an evening mountain bike trail ride. I stopped at the amphitheater and was admiring the sunset and the beautiful evening. I always carry binoculars in my back pack when I ride and I was using them to view the sunset and the sky. I have been a very active skywatcher since the pentagon admission of UFOs and have tried to contact extraterrestrials using CE5 protocols several times this year. As I was watching the sunset and trees on the horizon I became filled with happiness and appreciation for life. A few seconds later I looked more directly above me and saw a ball of light that appeared to come down from the sky. The object was still very high up but was able to see clearly with naked eye. Sky was very blue and no stars were yet visible even through my binoculars. The object stayed for about 45 seconds and I was able to see it first through binoculars then took a couple pictures and a short video. Object was clearly not a star through binoculars. Stayed stationary and hovered before shooting back up. The orb was changing shape while seeing through binoculars. I started getting shook up while video tapping and then the object took off. This was the life changing event I needed. They're real. Content-type: text/html,,A large Squarish Blue Light over Maya Plaza in Fresno Ca.,beautiful,DSC2541.jpg DSC2541.jpeg,"Fresno,CA "

MUFON,2020-04-26 9:05PM,4/26/20,,Lemont,IL ,ILLINOIS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report My son and I were Standing in front of my house in the evening on Sept 13th approximately 10pm. My son was looking to the North and asked me what was in the sky. I looked up and saw about 7 glowing lights in a line just above the neighbors house and to the right. They looked as if they were coming toward us but very far away. There was no noise. At first they were a bit faint until my eyes zoomed in on them. I proceeded to take pictures of them as they started traveling toward the West. The color of the objects changed to white and they would glow then completely disappear. There looked to be about 7 of them in formation when I first saw them. Then as they traveled and turned white to black I would only see at times 3 and sometimes 5. I took a short video as well. They were moving pretty quickly so I didn't have a lot of time to observe them. It wasn't until I reviewed the photos that I realized there were 2 even larger black triangle objects traveling even higher with the other formation below. They were triangle shape with bright white lights on the corners and possibility one white light in the middle. My neighbor was taking pictures of the moon that evening and captured 3 photos with the lower formation and they were spread across the sky above and below the moon at times in the pictures. She captured them in th East and you can clearly see black triangles with no light (moonlight captured them). She said they were not visible until she looked at her photos.

MUFON,2019-12-22 7:30PM,12/23/19,,Howell,MI ,MICHIGAN,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report On May 26 at 9:45 PM in a dark rural area with few lights on a clear night with stars visible 3 people saw a huge object silently fly overhead from South to North or Northeast. At first the person who spotted it thought she was seeing Orion's belt but realized it was three evenly-spaced lights that looked like stars moving quickly across the sky. We all saw it realized it was not a plane satellite or shooting star so we grabbed binoculars. We took turns quickly looking at the object as it flew overhead. Through binoculars each of us saw a very long narrow rectangular shape dark gray or possibly black with three evenly spaced white lights in a line down the middle of the rectangle. There were many less bright white lights forming a straight line evenly-spaced between the three brighter lights. The bright lights were bright enough through the binoculars that you could detect the surface of the object but no details or features just a slight illumination from the lights. It appeared to have a rim along each long side of the object. One person thought she could detect small lights on the edges. The other two saw only a distinct object edge or outline. The object obscured stars behind it as it passed across the sky so it was solid in appearance. We were all unsure of the exact shape of the leading edge of the object but our impression was that it was flat like the small end of a rectangle. It was incredibly long and it seemed to us all that there was not a distinct tail end that we could detect because we could make out lights going quite far back from the three prominent lights. One person said it seemed like 2 aircraft carriers in length. All agreed that it was shockingly large and that description seemed like it could have been accurate even though we couldn't tell how high up it was. It seemed to be at a lower altitude than jets appear to be when you see them as little pinpoints in the sky but we had a hard time judging altitude and size because it seemed very large and there was nothing in the sky to compare it to. There was no noise or other feature. There were no wings or other visible structures and no apparent exhaust. It gave us all the impression of seeing a long train travelling across the sky. The movement was steady and fast. It crossed from one horizon to the other and then passed out of sight in minutes. We noted the time when it passed out of view at 9:50 PM. After seeing it we all went inside and decided to separately draw what we saw. Our drawings were almost exactly the same and we agreed on all details except whether there were lights on the long edges. We all agreed that we could not detect the end of the object but that it nonetheless moved out of view. Only one of us claimed to have ever seen a UFO before. All three are generally sceptical and level-headed people. We were not drunk or under the influence of anything. I am reporting this for us all. I have never before seen a UFO. Anything ""unidentified"" I've seen I've either assumed or found out was either a weather balloon or military aircraft. This sighting completely mystifies me. I cannot imagine anything that large or that shape travelling through the air let alone at that speed and steadiness. It was enough of a shock that it genuinely scared our friend visiting from Florida. Afterwards I tried googling this and found no similar reports. I then found this website. I think after reporting it here I'll try to find out if I can report it to Kirtland Airforce Base.

The two main lights pulse quite bright and then dim down to original brightness the craft then keeps its flight path and disappears into cloud cover. I pointed the craft out to my girlfriend right after the lights pulsate (not flash as a commercial airliner would on the wings) I say “are you seeing the same thing I am right now?” She replies yes and starts freaking out when she notices it doesn’t have wings and is not a normal airplane. Both continue driving after the craft goes into cloud cover and disappears. She is spooked after she drops me off and I tell her to drive safe.

MUFON,2017-10-15 8:11PM,10/15/17,,Brenham,TX ,TEXAS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Came home and saw 5 lights in a line. One by one the ships would break off to a spot further south and glow extremely bright and then seem to burn out. A red light would be left. The small light would then head north under the rest of the line. The next ship in line would then fly to the same spot repeating the process of growing very bright and abruptly dimming. All 5 finished in order and met up in the northeast portion of the sky. Two lights would fly parallel to one another until one suddenly flew upward toward the other. They seem to be 'playing' in the sky. The UFOs seemed to disguise themselves as planes emitting a jet-like sound but only making these noises sometimes as if on cue. More ships were spotted in the north spread out over about a mile distance there was about 5. One flew directly overhead and seemed almost star-shaped. From far away they would sometimes look like 2 small yellow orbs and one red orb in between but would change pattern as light was reduced or gained. The lights seemed to enjoy traveling in close proximity to one another. The ships should not be mistaken for planes as they would ascend or descend in a straight up or down line and were often seen hovering. I felt slightly scared as the one passed directly overhead but mostly remained in awe. I was so amazed and excited. The objects remained in the sky for a long time flying to different parts.

As I approached McCaleb Rd I saw several bright reddish lights in a line traveling East. The lights appeared to be closer to the ground than a plane would fly. I believed the lights to be part of a military training exercise at first. The lights passed over me and continued East then lost sight of them. I thought they may be UFOs but I didn't see anybody else on the hwy stop so I just continued home.

MUFON,2015-08-09 9:00PM,11/26/15,,parker,CO ,COLORADO,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report I was at home just getting ready to go to sleep after a long day at a convention in Los Angeles. On a whim I poked my head out of my window to take a glance at the dark blue light from the soon-to-be-rising sun. At that time approximately 5-5:30AM I spotted something odd in the sky. I'm a fairly intelligent and rational sort of person so I went through the standard list of what it could be. I live close enough to Ontario International Airport that I'm no stranger to aircraft of varying types including blimps which look rather strange at night. I also know what a satellite usually looks like what a shooting star looks like what planets look like and this only resembled possibly a satellite or string of satellites. In my excitement I woke my parents who weren't too happy to hear from me saying ""Hey wanna see a UFO?"" All three of us looked out the window to spy whatever it was. My step-father immediately said he believed it to be a geosynchronous or geostationary set of 3 satellites and they returned to bed. While I don't want to discredit his assumption I looked through a small set of binoculars at the lights to try and get a clearer view. The centermost light was the brightest and the other two on either side seemed dimmer. I'm not sure if it was due to something on the glasses of the binoculars but it also seemed almost like it was refracted/reflected somewhat by the atmosphere. Though I'm fairly certain there were in fact three separate lights in a line. They also moved very very slowly. So slowly so as to be almost imperceptible. If they were geostationary or geosynchronous satellites as my step-father suggested it's possible they were simply moving with the rotation of the planet around their orbit somewhat though I'm unsure if such things are able to be viewed from the ground and I am also unsure if they appear to move at all since doing so seems to violate the name of the orbits in question. I ultimately lost sight of the object(s) when it(they) became too hard to see from my bedroom window and I went to bed. I tried to find a list of satellites overhead at the time but I'm not an astronomer and most satellites that were overhead were listed with a lot of information I didn't understand. No planets were overhead in that direction of which I am aware either and I do know it was not in fact the ISS if that helps. Overall I wasn't scared just curious. I'd really really like to know what it was that I saw. By all technical definition it is currently an Unidentified Flying Object but even if it just turns out to be some satellites in a strange orbit I'd like to know what they are what they do and all that. I hope to get some clarification soon. Content-type: text/html",,{rjl} 4 red and 4 green orbs changing to one fast right angle moves,lights in a line,MOL012.mp4,"parker,CO "

MUFON,2014-07-01 12:00AM,5/23/15,,Montgomery,TX ,TEXAS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Leaving my girlfriends aunt and uncles house for Thanksgiving at almost exactly 6pm this evening CST we waved goodbye and turned to walk to the car. Overhead there was a commercial aircraft in final approach to the nearby Nashville airport probably just under 1000 feet. As we were hearing the sound of their jets we both looked up and saw what looked like a Southwest airlines plane. As our angle of vision fell to about 45 to 35 degrees from the zenith angle above us my girlfriend and I both saw the glow of 3 orange/red lights in a triangular formation. At first it looked like 3 lights on the tips of what would have been a tremendous singular entity but after 2 or 3 seconds I decided that they were 3 separate entities flying in a formation. As they moved from the northwest to the northeast across the sky with moderate speed a 4th 5th and 6th light appeared to come into view from the same northwestern position following the path and at the same speed except that the 4th 5th and 6th lights were in a row with considerable distance between them like periods of ellipses with a lot of space between them. The lights themselves were a constant brightness the entire time they were visible with a large steady broadcast rather than a pulse blink fireball afterburner or alternating frequency. My first thought was that it was the Astra TR-3B at a very low altitude but then my second thought was that it was a military helicopter formation. Upon further thought though at that distance we should have heard some sort of noise had they been helicopters. As it moved towards the east it passed behind some tall trees and the triangle was gone. Behind it trailed the 3 lights in a linear row 1 of which at some point in view turned its light off and thus disappeared without seeming to change direction or leave its flight pattern. We all watched as the last of the lights faded behind the trees. I would not have filed this report except that my girlfriend googled something about lights in the sky in Nashville and someone else had filed what sounds like this same set of circumstances but from much further east in Hendersonville NC.

Approx 10:15pm I noticed a very bright and large ""star"" just under Orions left foot and just to the right of the North star. It appeared ""closer"" and brighter than I thought a star should be and was blinking colors sort of like a planet does. Initially I got a cheap pair of binoculars from the house but they made viewing worst. So I grabbed my phone. I have Droid Maxx and switched on the video camera. What I saw will blow you away! Initially before I zoomed in the single bright blinking light became four distinct lights in a line in sort of the traditional saucer pattern. A series of 3 to 4 lights would flash across in a straight line with the two on each end. When I zoomed in after a minute or so it was the mist incredible thing Ive EVER seen. MASSIVE object (only can see black outline of craft) but it was covered in many lights that blinked and flashed dome in sequence and some random. The craft is cigar shaped with a sail shape on one end. Distinct bright flashing red light towards top part of ""sail"" structure and dozens of other lights all over the craft. I have close to 5 mins of video which I have not released but will after I protect my rights to it and have some ""professionals"" validate it. I want no chance of hoax or anything else.

MUFON,2014-02-04 11:29PM,2/5/14,,Fort Worth,TX ,TEXAS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report We were watching fireworks over Little Lake Conway on 4th of July 2013. The Orlando International Airport is in the distance to the east of us. The planes take off and land in one of two directions north and south. Coming towards us from the eastern sky were 5 orange-reddish lights in a line formation. This was very odd because there were planes coming in for landing from the north. Nothing ever comes from the east it is in the way of the planes path to the airport. The lights continued to come towards our direction steadily until they reached the end of the lake where we were standing then they turn to the north at this point they were at the closest point to us. We could not make out what shape they were. We did not hear a sound from them. We watched them continue moving in a very smooth movement all 5 of them stayed in a row at a set distance from each other. The color is not a color of any aircraft we have ever seen. This is the second time we have seen these orange colored lights in this area. Both times they were in places that planes do not fly. We know the path of the planes for the airport. We often sit at the lake and watch them come in for landing over the lake from the north to the south. The light then went behind the clouds one at a time.

MUFON,2013-07-04 9:15PM,7/5/13,,Orlando,FL ,FLORIDA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Similar to sighting I reported in MUFON Case Number 39678 - Same location and type of craft - clear skies - No clouds - Loud plane brought me outside onto patio then I observed the object in almost same location as previous mentioned case. This time there were NO clouds and a crisp cool evening with very clear skies. Object emitted similar lights - I observed through binos again and it was clearly NOT a usual aircraft. I went inside after 5 minutes to try and get cameras but batteries were dead again (argh). After several minutes messing with cameras I went back outside and object was GONE with NO visable stars in that area that were anywhere as bright as the objects lights. Object had 3 white lights in a line close together but space between lights. There was a reddish light on top of oval that appeared at irregular moments. There was also a smaller light on bottom middle of object that was not as bright as the others. If only I had the proper equipment to capture images or video of these object. They are close enough to get quality images IF only I had proper equipment. It is very frustrating. In my opinion these object are near shoreline of protected unoccupied coastal area of the SF Bay near some commercial complexes. From my position they were directly above a nearby buildings chimney while it was in the sky so I had a great reference point to guage the location it was above. The land I was on is much higher than the land it was above so my view of the object can be estimated by pointing your arm straight out front of yourself and raising your hand to head level to obtain my line of sight of the object. I really want to get some visual record of these events but you never know when they will become visable and its usually extremely early in the day at about 2 to 3 am which is when they seem to be active.

MUFON,2013-06-22 10:30PM,6/23/13,,Prospect,PA ,PENNSYLVANIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Last night on the 27th of November 2012 my adult son called me outside to our backyard telling me I had to see the weird lights in the sky. I hurried out looking to the East/ slightly South with two grandchildren aged 10 and 9. We all saw three red lights in a line at first. I would guess that the object was quarter of a mile at most away and very low to the treeline far past our neighbors rooftop. We have standard rambler style homes and this craft at that distance was at least half the length of their house. It appeared to be moving about 45 degrees off the horizon (Cant see the horizon due to trees in the area so this is a guess) and coasted smooth and silent no jerky movements. Also there were shimmerings of red lights that would appear along the edge that faced me though these were hard to see. The lights pulsed repeatedly but they looked nothing like anti-collison lights on the aircaft we have seen thousands of times in our area. Within a minute or two the lights took on a triangular shape that was huge. It seemed to pivot and turn while slowly lifting the front edge as if it was a single large craft or if it were several flying in unison the back ones lifted up. At any rate the entire group of lights slipped to the South East and apparently down into the Auburn Valley area. I attempted to record the sighting but since it was dark the video from my cellphone doesnt show much. In between the very excited yelling of myself and the elder grandchild there is a noticable silence. Any aircraft that we have seen would have shaken the house at such a low altitude and proximity. There is also a report on the MUFON site that almost exactly mirrors ours case # 44199 from Kent that happened two hous after ours and to the North and East of us. My son submitted his report last night after we saw it and the MUFON site had not yet been contacted by the people in Kent that also saw it. It helps to know someone else witnessed this interesting sighting. Content-type: text/html,,{nd} more than 10 lights in the sky,lights in a line,082.MOV,"Prospect,PA "
MUFON,2013-04-18 2:30AM,4/18/13,,Richmond,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report 1. It was around 10:30 pm when I went outside to go down to the local dock on the intracoastal to do some night time photography. I was shooting the reflection of the buildings across the body of water. 2. I first noticed the lights in post processing. In one of the images I discovered this cluster of lights. I would have written it of as stars if I wouldnt have gotten a second picture less than a minute after the first one shooting at a slightly different direction. Both these images were taken from the same location I didn't move my tripod and they were shot with a 50mm f1.4 which does not have any zoom therefor there is no alteration in appearance. 3. At first I tried to decide if it was a plane or helicopter. In the past I had done night time long exposure in which I would take pictures over a 20 to 30 seconds period and I would get planes displayed in the results as multiple lights in a line that would repeat themselves. This was taken in 0.8 sec which would not allow the plane to move as far. Then in the second image one of the lights is moving or accelerating at enormous speeds considering this image had been taken in 0.8 seconds. 4. I have no information on that. All my conclusions are drawn from the images. 5. I am not arrogant enough to believe that we are the only intelligent beings out there and having shot my own proof not having to rely on other peoples material that may or may not be fake made me feel glad to know it to be true. I didn't feel the need to share it but after watching MUFON investigation on the Destination America channel they were encouraging to share any information on UFOs that is when I dug out the picture and send it off. The only alteration I made on the images is to higher the exposure and increase sharpness to make the lights more visible. If required I do have the RAW files as well. 6.

As I was headed south torwards downtown I looked out to the west and there was literally 20 to 25 orbs of lights in a line sttreaching from the north to south in groups of threes. as the each group get over the skyliine of downtown seattle the lights would dimm out and you could see the circular form of the objects and this went on from one group to the next til they all reach the downtown skyline and what was weird was that there was a single object that was at the end of the fleet and it turned and went northwest as the rest continued south. Now i heard of seeing 1 or 2 objects but a fleet of 20 to 25. unreal.

MUFON,2012-04-25 11:03PM,11/12/12,,Tequesta,FL ,FLORIDA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report At about 2:00 AM on Friday morning November 4 2011 I went outside for a cigarette and was looking up at the stars as I always do. The sky was clear and the stars were out. I saw 3 lights in a triangular shape move quickly across the sky from SSE to NNW. The lights were dim and there was no noise. The lights were solid and not blinking they were white in color and just before it went out of view they switched positions. They could have been 1 craft rotating or 3 different craft switching positions. But the impression I got was that it was one craft with 3 lights. I watched the skies for a bit longer then went inside to text about it. I then went back outside about 15 minutes later and at about 2:20 am saw about 7-8 dim white lights in a line each light slightly staggered from the previous one. This object moved as one object it was likely a cigar shaped craft and it moved from North to South. It appeared to be higher in the sky than the first one I saw.

MUFON,2012-06-30 4:37AM,6/30/12,,Los Angeles,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report Ok ill start by saying I was coming come from Shell gas station on rt. 33 in Twin Rivers NJ. I was on Cedarville road and got to the end. I turned left onto Windsor-Perrinville road East Windsor and started driving for my road. As i was headed for my road I see a light through the trees in the eastern skyies. I dismiss totally as the moon and I look back down at my iphone. I was listening to the espn radio app. Then as i get to a place where the trees stop i live my small farms so fields around me and flat land. Well the trees stop and then i see it and it was gigantic. It was at the height of when you see a low flying plane. It was four lights across in a row maybe bout the size of half a football field. The two in the middle were very bright almost like it's headlights but the light was very diffused. The craft was coming from the SE goin NW and moving incredibly slow. As far as shape i really couldn't tell because the lights were like so bright it was like when headlights are close to you all u see is the object and can't make out the object behind them. Never have i seen an airplane creep along in the sky or also be that damn huge. It seems like a cruise liner in the sky. So I see it on Windsor-Perrineville road and then i turn on to my road park sideway. Now i'm speeding trying to get home. I was terrified this thing was huge and it gave me the like worst feeling it had like a low hum. I felt so scared and alos hot all over. So I raced home and i cowardly didn't get a pic even though getting a picture wasn;t crossing my stupifyied mind when im watching this thing. So i race up my driveway use the clicker for my door and stop right before i go into the garage (my little bit of courage). I look up to see the craft going not over my house but close i guess like adjacent. That's when i saw the blinking red light on the bottom of the craft... so i obviously wake my mom up shes a scientist and is sketipic but could tell that i was very raddled. We go back out in the car and look for the object but cant find it. I come home and immediatley search ""nj ufos"" and i find an article from three days ago. About people on the turnpike seeing something similar. That's when i was shocked because i read words in the article which seemed to be spot on to what i saw. They descibed it as being moon like too which was creepy but the big kicker is that they reported the blinking red light on the bottom going every 3 seconds. I didn't measure or time it out but that seems correct. The pictures looked like what i saw but from a very far distance but i could see a camera making it look like that blended the four lights together to look like a bright one. I then actually emailed Roger Marsh the author of the article because I didn't know where to tell this was my immediate idea.  Here's what I wrote via copy paste. [Name removed/cms/tg] to TremontAvenue show details 12:50 AM (9 hours ago) Hi there My name is [Name removed/cms/tg]. I just saw the most gigantic thing in the sky i have ever seen I was driving home from rt. 33 in twin rivers nj and I started seeing a light through the trees i thought it was the moon because of the size. as i got closer and to a treeless section my house is my fields i saw this gigantic object.. it was four lights across and i really couldnt make out the shape but it was huge...I mistaked it for the moon. Also the two lof the lights in front werre lighting up infront of it almost headlight like but not really. I was terrifed I had an omminous feeling iver never felt and I just raced up..there was a car behind me they had to of seen this thing. I jsut saw it like 30 min ago its 12:46 am on jun 22. I didn't snap a pic becuase of my fear and raced to my house i opend my garage door with the clicker to see the craft pass over top not like right over top my house but adjacent..I saw the bottom of the craft had a red blinking light..Now comes the reason im eamiling you..I searched nj ufo and saew the articel u did from 3 days ago about the turnpike ufo ppl saw.. What i saw was brigth as hell like that also i saw that they spoke of the same blinking light on the bttm..Also i live bout 3 miles from the turnpike exit 8...Im srry my grammar is bad an my sentence structure but i don't know where to report this thing..I don't think it was a pyramid or triangle but more flat but like i said i couldnt see shape i saw four lights in a line. like o O O o and the O were like the bright headlight type things. I don't know where to report this if you can give me information. That thing was gigantic.. Reply Forward Roger Marsh [name removed/cms/tg] - thanks for writing. Please report your UFO experience at the Mutual UF... 1:51 AM (8 hours ago) Reply [Name removed/cms/tg] to Roger show details 1:55 AM (8 hours ago) I will report tomorrow..I'm just stunned that they are real I've always believed but to see was crazy like a cruise liner in the sky also there was a Hum maybe a freq made me feel so terrified I feel like such a coward that I didn't get a picture..I'm down for an interview but first I got to get some sleep Ty for reponding fast. Sent from my iPhone - Show quoted text - Reply Forward Reply Roger Marsh to me show details 2:05 AM (8 hours ago) Thanks [name removed/cms/tg]. Get some sleep. I just walked in the door and checked my email before going to bed. Glad to have responded so fast. My personal sighting was incredible too - was within 30 feet of a disc-shaped object. Wild. Talk soon. Let me know when you're up for a chat. Thanks for filing the report tomorrow. Now I'm just like incredibly interested in what I saw. It really had like a military feel to it and the blinking red light i think kinda leans toward that way. But really i want to get across that it had a very dark ominous feeling and was terrified by the sheer size. I have always believed and been curious about UFOs and read the internet article here or there but I'm like really happy to KNOW now that they're real. Truthfully i thought if i ever saw one it would be from far and maybe a cool color changing thing but no what i saw was a.) close b.) gigantic and c.)bright white lights almost like a airplanes but like 3 times as bright. Also i'm now just even more curious to see if anyone else reports this..There was a car behind me at the time on Windsor-Perrineville they had to of seen this thing it was huge and incredibly bright again i mistaken it for the moon so there you go. I'm a filmmaker and would like to investigate ALL of NJ's cases and would happy to do a phone interview or talk with whoever. This was scary in person but exciting after the fact very happy that they're TRUE. -[name removed/cms/tg] Content-type: text/html",,{nd} Saw three white lights one dissapeared then two white lights got brighter and smaller object near starlike lights.,lights in a line,,"Los Angeles,CA "

One of them flew over behind us and stopped and was fading in and out in and out and one of the other ones flew around it. Then they just started to disappear into the sky.

MUFON,2011-11-04 2:05AM,11/4/11,,College Station,TX ,TEXAS,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report This is a report I received from my daughter whom I shall refer to as Bink. She wishes to remain anonymous. During the concert Ozzy was playing the song Suicide Solution and the audience was looking at Ozzy. Bink glanced towards the Little Dipper at the time. A UFO appears away from the stage while everyone (she assumes) was watching towards the stage away from the UFO. This is the report directly. I collected the report as it was fresh in her mind. The shape was triangular with rounded tips. The color of the craft was a pale gray. The middle looking on edgewise was slightly rounded and thicker in the middle which held 3 round lights in a line strobe-like. Colors were green yellow and pinkish purple. The lights were like a strobe that blinked and flashed 3-5 times before it disappeared behind a tree that it fit behind. Bink said the distance was up higher than any conventional aircraft. The craft made no noise but it flew horizontally then flew up then hovered then shook as it left. Bink recognized that it was unlike anything she had ever seen before and she seen it as it was (a weird UFO). She has never seen anything like this before and it was the first thing she said to me when she got home that night with her Dad who didn't see a thing. She said ""Guess who just saw a freaking UFO"" were her words exactly. Content-type: text/html",,Multiple sightings in one night,lights in a line,,"College Station,TX "

Rt.113 runs west over I-91 at exit 14 about 1/2 between the top and bottom of Vermont. Perfectly clear night. Lots of stars. Great unseasonably warm weather -- not even a light jacket! First driving N on 91 between exits 13 and 14: behind the trees; a low line of lights. I think: ""towers"" - no not towers. ""plane"" - no too low and not moving fast enough. Huh. We are discussing the new TV show ""V"". I am listening to the kids and watching these lights trying to figure out what is causing them.... Wonder what that is... then --- It Disappears. Totally gone. I say out loud to my kids: ""that's just not right!!"" Obviously light ""disappearing is not ""normal"". My two children young teens both saw the lights and agreed; Just Not normal for them to disappear like that..... . Drove along thinking about this.... and the road turns a bit and there they are - again....a perfect line of lights -- just appears again.... this time in FULL view over the highway. 3 to 4 Cars had pulled over to watch. It was 4 white lights in a line; perfect equi-distanace from each other traveling slowly and close to us / although I wasn't worried about anything ""bad"" happening. The last light (right side -goes off -- gone. The first farthest left light shoots out a light to the left; which stops equi-distance from the other ones; keeping the perfect formation. Then another farthest right light disappears. Just gone. The farthest left light shoots another light out to the left; creating the same line of a perfect 4 lights - all equi-distant from each other; all moving slowly to the left (west)...

I happened to look up to see 2 bright lights in a line with a dark narrow object in between it was very hard to see and very thin aprox 250' in length. I watched it for 2 or 3 minutes as it crossed the river from Illinois into Iowa then overhead. It stayed on the same path which would be sw to ne. The thing that caught my eye was there were no strobe lights or red and green nav lights only bright white lights at the front and back. It was maybe at 1000 ft. and made absolutely no noise. AS it moved the tailing light would move to the right 20 degrees back to center for awhile and move 20 degrees to the left. It left my sight at a high rate of speed as it moved up and over the hill to my northeast. When it was overhead it made me a little apprehensive and the dog acted a little strange wanting to head towards the house up the street.

MUFON,2010-08-14 12:00AM,8/16/10,,Devore,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report I work for a septic company. We have a dump site in Desdemona where we dump septic in a field fully authorized. Back to the story. I worked late that day up around Possum kingdom. I had a septic to do at 7 am the next morning. So i was emptying my septic truck after dark approx 7:25pm I pulled into the field and was turning my truck around to empty it and i noticed that Venus was really bright. Once i got my truck situated I looked back into the sky and saw Venus on the northern side of me. I looked back to where i saw ""Venus"" the first time and there was nothing. I chalked it up to being tired and started to empty my truck. That's when i glanced back and saw at least three orange round lights in the sky. They were just above the horizon to the south flashing/blinking on and off in a distinct pattern. I looked across the horizon on the other side of me at the wind turbines. They have red lights that flash at night. The patterns were similar. I looked back at the ""freaky lights."" they had went from three lights to four lights in a line. I called my wife freaking out. The lights were taking turns turning on and off. Then they ""developed"" a tail. A fifth possibly sixth light appeared and made a tail similar to a kite tail. A 45 degree angle more like. so in all there were up to six lights in the shape of a triangle. The tip pointing south/south west. The whole event that I witnessed lasted maybe 3-4 minutes. i looked at my phone it was 7:25. I stayed in the field watching the skies for about 10 more minutes. Then I drove the 20 miles back to Stephenville parked my truck and came home. The next day there were reports in the paper about the freaky lights in Desdemona. I reported two days later to the local newspaper Empire Tribune. This was Thursday night of February Fifth. Several people reported seeing the lights from Hwy 108. I was just off of hwy 16 some 25-30 miles west. I believe i saw the formation from the other side. At least i saw it from a different angle/ perspective. Sorry i waited so long to report to you. I did not feel comfortable to write about it. 1. I was in Desdemona 20 miles west of Stephenville. I was 3 miles north of Desdemona on hwy 16. I was on county road 509. 2. I first noticed it cause it was bright. 3. i first thought it was Venus. 4. See story. 5. Scared [cms/tg/pd] ask my wife. 6. The object just stopped flashing on and off.

Outside of Breckenridge I told my husband to look at those bright lights in the sky. He also saw them. It almost looked liked car lights spread out with a very large light in the center (probably about 3-4 times bigger than outside lights. There were 3 sets of them in a straight line really huge. Each light blinked off and on at different intervals then the end lights faded out followed by the first and second sets. Thinking this was really weird (I figured maybe it was some kind of military pratice) I kept my eyes on the sky looking for other lights. About the time we were outside Cisco I told my husband to look at the sky again. There were some more lights. This time there were just 3 huge bright lights in a line across the sky. They seemed to be darting back and forth. The only other way to explain it was maybe there were more lights and they flashed off and on and just looked to be darting.....Then all of them faded. I had never seen anything like this before and told my husband I figured if I ever had I would have been scared but I wasn't. Perhaps if I had been traveling alone I might have been. It was a really neat and am very glad I got to experience it. By the way when I heard others had seen them I realized that these lights were probably over the Stephenville area. Also I had a camera in the back of the car. I was really mad at myself when I realized I could have taken pictures. There was plenty of time to do so.

MUFON,2008-10-29 7:45PM,11/9/08,,Abilene TX,TX ,TEXAS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report 'My brother and I were travelling home from what was unfortunately our step-grandmother's wake when we saw three rather bright lights in a line to the left of the car. I guess it was around 8:30-8:40 p.m. It consisted of three bright white lights in a triangle with a red light positioned just behind the forward point. The front light was brighter than the others. The red light did not flash like one on a jet but rather it pulsed fairly slowly growing bright then fading out. At its closest its wingspan looked fairly consistent with Orion's Belt in the night sky if not a little larger. There was some noise associated with it but if it was a jet the noise was far too soft- almost just like wind blowing and sometimes a low hum. When we first witnessed the object my girlfriend who was following us in her car called me about the time I reached for my phone to call her. It was hard to miss. The object stayed on our left side thought the road turned a bit but it did get almost directly overhead at one point. As we passed under it it was out of sight for a couple moments then ended up along side us again travelling a completely different direction from when we first saw it. A couple miles down we parked to see if we could snap a picture of it on our camera-phones but they're pretty usless for that sort of thing. As we were parked watching it it turned at almost a 90 degree angle and started heading away again. This time we decided to head home. Once we arrived there we saw it cross overhead infront of us head into the tree line. It then turned away again and came into view and it then came directly towards us and when it was at about a 45 to 60 degree angle infront of us it a sharp turn to the left and headed into the horizon- still heading away from the nearest airport or military base. As I stated before the sound was nothing like a jet more like a steady rush of air as if from a fan. My girlfriend and I left to run some quick errands and my brother called me back to tell me he could hear the noise from inside the house much louder this time but when he got outside could not locate the object. The reason it baffles me is that the nearest airport is 30+ miles away. If it was a jet it was very lost. It was circling our little town randomly making very un-jet-like turns. Ontop of that as I stated before there were no strobes only the three brights and the one red pulse. I hope this helps! Good luck out there!

MUFON,2008-08-25 10:33PM,8/26/08,,#VALUE!,NV ,NEVADA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Sighting Report: At about 8:40 p.m. on March 21 2005 I was driving north on Michigan Road (US 421) from Zionsville towards my house located just north of 146th Street (CR 300S). The sky was clear. As I approached the stoplight at the intersection of 146th Street and Michigan Road I noticed up in the sky just a bit to my right and at what appeared to be several thousand feet up a line of three bright orangy-yellow lights - similar to the color and intensity of warning lights on highways at night. The line of three lights was moving slowly to the north. At first I thought I was seeing a large airplane - I momentarily thought it might be a C5A or a 747 that was flying low - but then remembered that neither one of these planes would have three lights of this color in a row (wingtip-center-wingtip) so it then struck me that this was something I had never seen before. I thus brought what I saw to the attention of my wife (sitting next to me) and my son (sitting in the back seat) who both looked up and said they saw the same thing I described and were as confused as I was regarding what we were looking at. After about three seconds one of the lights dimmed and then went out then it came back on as the others dimmed and went out and then the one that had gone out the first time and came back on again dimmed and went off. By this time we had turned into our subdivision so I parked the car so my sone and I could get out and try to see the lights again. We did; this time though we only saw two and they were several miles away but still headed in a northerly direction. As before after about ten seconds the two lights dimmed and then went out. My son and I continued to watch the sky for ten more minutes but never saw the lights again so we got back in the car and drove home getting there about 9:00 p.m. My interest piqued I then went outside to see if I saw the lights again. I did. At about 9:10 I again saw three lights of the same color but not the same intensity as by now they appeared to be about 15 miles north of where I was seemingly over the town of Kirklin IN. What I saw this time was two lights in a line and one light above the one on the left. They stayed on for about 15 seconds then the leftmost of the two dimmed and went out and then the other two dimmed and went out. About five minutes later in the same spot I saw two of the three lights come one again for about 10 seconds before then dimmed and went out. I stayed outside for about 10 more minutes but never saw the lights again so I went inside for the night. For the record I called the Exectutive airport near out house to ask if anyone there knew of anything going on - they didn t and hadn t seen the lights - and I called the newsroom at the Indianapolis Star to report what I had seen but was told I was the only person who had called that evening. I still haven t a clue what my son my wife and I saw but after reading some of the postings from the April 2004 flap over north central Indiana I realized that other people have seen the same thing I saw so now I am really interested in learning more. Please feel free to contact me if you need any additional information. Thank you.

MUFON,2005-01-10 12:00AM,1/16/08,,Cisco,TX ,TEXAS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Around 1:30 on Oct 25th I stepped out on the porch to get a breath of fresh air. I saw three lights in a line approx 30-40 ft over a treeline about 34 of a mileaway. Actual footage cannot be calculated because there wasn't an accurate third point for triangulation. I called for both my wife and son to come out to see it. The three of us viewed the objects for about 5 min before all three lights began to tilt and raise slightly. The right light Highest cut off shortly followed by the other two in unison as the light cluster began to take off. We waited to see if the sillouette would go over us but the objects must have taken a different flight path. North Easternly path @ 15-40 degree Notes. No noise. Perfectly motionless hover. Estimated distance from outside light to outside light- 300-450 wide Again no third point for size triangulation.

Right behind it was another in same flight path then several more. You would see them in Northwest they would pop up and disappear. They kept on coming.

They all fell to the NE and then leveled out on the horizon(I want to point out that these were not falling stars. They were like satellites that had a mind of their own and would brighten as they entered the atmosphere. And they were slow. Each lasting a few minutes long) . They were all about 30 seconds to one minute apart. Once one would level off on the horizon the next would appear. We witnessed them as soon as we stepped outside and don't know how many happened before we came outside. Once we had witnessed the 21st star fall (the only one that fell to the south) they stopped. They weren't all in a perfect line but would all appear in the same general area. I've seen the Starlink satellites and these were not that. Please contact me.

After a few seconds there was another moving star going in the same direction as the first two. Another couple of seconds later there was a fourth star also headed in the direction of the other three stars. They moved so far then disappeared. I have seen moving stars for years but never this many at once. I read that the moving stars may be satellites but is it normal to see more than one traveling across the sky at the same time? And for some reason I have seen more moving stars in this area more than anywhere else. I can't really find anything online about moving stars that fade away.

MUFON,2020-10-22 5:20AM,10/22/20,,Kailua Kona,HI ,HAWAII,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I have been monitoring the skies each night because they have been SO busy. I don’t usually report the star-like sightings because I see them so frequently but this one was unique. Aircraft do not fly this close together. nor do they travel this fast. The first set was directly over my head. The first star-like craft projected a slightly golden/white solid light it looked like a swiftly moving star as usual. This time though another craft was following it it’s light was bright white and rapidly blinking. After they passed another set appeared to the East and nearer to Saturn/Jupiter from my POV. The first light was fixed and Star-light the one following it was like the other follower in the first set another rapidly blinking bright white light. Because they were so high up I couldn’t make out details but I could tell the lights were different. There was a pinky finger’s length distance between each craft when viewing from the ground. It was very bizarre and prior to this experience I have only seen the star light craft in singles. I couldn’t get it on film because they are so high up. My phone isn’t sufficient to capture them.

MUFON,2020-08-10 3:30AM,9/3/20,,Beaverton,OR ,OREGON,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was alone in my backyard on August 5th 2020 around 8pm it was a clear night I suddenly saw a slow moving star like object coming from the West I then used my Panasonic HC V180 Camcorder to start recording. I noticed it was turning South. It kept the same speed and it was silent. My video time show 2 minutes and 56 seconds. The object changed shape pulsating and was pink and green with white in the middle. I was shocked to see that an L.A. Resident captured the same object moving where he lived in an Article that was published. Both our UFO objects were exactly the same. I heard Helicopters but could not see them.

MUFON,2020-08-20 5:54AM,8/20/20,,Oakland,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report While looking outside to see if we can catch a glimpse of the comet (we didn't) we saw a very bright satellite that I tracked across the sky with my cell phone camera. However a little bit later i saw a strage flash in the direction of the big dipper. Then i saw for a second what looked like a satellite moving for a moment then a flash and it would disappear. Then flash again a little farther along it would appear move then disappear again. It would keep doing this flash then appear as a satellite (looking like a moving star) then would disappear then flash again farther ahead. The odd thing is that it seemed to have changed direction. At first it looked like it was heading west to east but then looked like it arched more north to where it was almost completely going north. I tried to get this on video on my cell phone but the flash wasn't long enough that my camera could pick it up. It's just a bunch of black sky.

MUFON,2020-08-08 9:34PM,8/8/20,,Pittsford,NY ,NEW YORK,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was driving to the store just after sunset on a clear night. I came to a stop sign at an intersection in our neighborhood. I stopped and was going to turn right on sussex but when I looked left to see if any car was coming I noticed three very strange pulsating orange oval shaped lights in a triangle formation coming up over the house tops and their were several groups of them. I was mesmerized by them I watched for awhile before I realized I had my phone and should take pictures of them. They moved very slowly and many of them didn't stay long they would ascend abruptly leaving the formations and disappearing in thin air but I was able to catch a few on photographs. The interesting thing is their were starlike white smaller objects surrounding them that moved with incredible speeds in crazy directions and then go back to a fixed position as if it was protecting these objects. I was able to get one of them in a short video but it was so fast it was hard to get a fix on it but you can see where it goes crazy on the video. Their were a lot of them I first thought they may be Chinese lanterns in the sky because they just hovered in place pulsating a bright orange color but I ruled out lanterns when some of them ascended so quickly and then just disappeared. plus I have never seen anything like the fast moving starlike objects around them. I watched for awhile as several groups came and went going west to east some stopping and hovering I took some short videos and pictures before it was freaking me out and I left.

They kept coming for over 10 minutes and once the line was done the two that were hovering watching then joined them .

MUFON,2020-07-14 10:20PM,7/15/20,,SALIDA,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Stepped outside with my fiance and a couple that we are friends with. As soon as I stepped out I was compelled to look up and immediately noticed something strange. There were 6 lines of moving starlight orbs that appeared to be higher then even commercial jets fly. Orbs were being omitted out of some non visible craft or item in the sky(guessing it was cloaked in some way). I even grabbed one of my high power spotting scopes to attempt to get a better view of what the moving objects were and what they were coming from. With 60x magnification I was still unable to get any definite detail. After about 2 minutes of watching the several lines of orbs moving in all directions all lines stopped omitting new orbs except one in the sky about 45° up that continued. It continues for about 15-20min sending out another 50-70 orbs(not including all the initial intersecting ones in the beginning). The very last 2 orbs omitted were the only 2 that didn't follow a straight line or stay constantly illuminating the whole time they were seen. The final 2 were 1 behind the other and the first one turn to the west and traveled for a short distance and stopped and just sat there. The second one curved to the East and then back to the South were for the rest of the trip southward it swerved around in the sky. Once the second wasn't viable the first one started west again and then cut back southward also moving erratically in the sky and began to slow pulse it's lights. There was 6 witnesses from 3 locations that i called and had go outside to witness it. This is coming after a large number of sightings the last couple weeks that I considered reporting but after this I had to take the time and contact Mufon. Any questions feel free to contact me.

MUFON,2020-04-25 11:11PM,4/26/20,,Lakewood,WA ,WASHINGTON,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report At 9:50pm EST my son called me saying I needed to go outside and look up at the sky he was seeing multiple star like objects in a linear path moving from the northwest to the south west of the sky I went outside while still on the phone he told me to look at the moon and then go to the moons 1 o’clock I picked up a moving star like object and then was able to see more right after it. I counted 8 moving across the sky in a linear formation. My son had seen more before he called me. Said he saw 25 total moving in a caravan type line across the sky. Equally spaced apart from each other moving at a good speed one right after another. I have never seen these star like objects in such a convo of movement. They faded out of view as they traveled SW In the next 45 mins I saw 4 more star like objects moving across the sky until faded out of view. None had noise all just looked like rapidly moving stars until they fade out or just disappear. My son and I live approximately 3 miles from each other. We saw this event and discussed while on phone during the sighting. I have seen many of these star like objects moving across the sky over many years. Never have I seen a caravan of them moving like what I saw last night! One right after another after another. My son counted 25 I saw 8 by the time he called me and I ran outside.

MUFON,2020-04-15 8:00PM,4/15/20,,Bessemer,AL ,ALABAMA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I walked outside at 840pm (CST) and always look up at the stars as my dogs do their business. I spotted Mars in the sky and orions belt and went inside to grab my wife so she could see Mars as well. We walked outside again and looked up. I pointed at Orions belt and then to Mars and as we were looking in the same path of our view a 'quick moving star' was silently and rapidly moving across the sky. I thought it was entirely too fast for a plane and my wife stated it could be a satelite. As she stated that we noticed another 'star' moving quickly behind it. It was staying at the same speed as the first one and moving along the same path then another and another. My wife still insisted it could have been a couple of satelites and as she said that we kept spotting these moving objects one after another. We watched as they passed over head about 12 equally spaced fast moving bright objects moving faster than a plane no blinking lights and remaining equally spaced. After about 12-14 of them there was a gap and then another light appeared along the same path. Then more equally spaced lights sped across the sky just as bright then another gap. We then noticed after the third gap that a pair of lights appeared in the same trajectory and moving as fast as the others but they remained adjacent to each other and sped across the sky. While watching this pair another light appeared midway on the path and headed from north to south where as these objects and their path traveled from SW to NE in a relatively straight path. While this was occurring we noticed that another light appeared like the others a little dimmer and it looked as if those two lights were going to impact each other as they cross but the light NOT on the path sped up and was not even close when their paths crossed. While these lights continued and newly arrving lights appeared slightly dimmer but on the same path and still spaced equal distance from each other a plane was spotted with its strobe and other lights clearly identified. This plane was going the normal speed planes travel and normal altitude expected. In relation to the plane these objects were lower (closer to earth than the plane). After 20-30 minutes the lights no longer appeared. We watched some of the lights closer to the front of the line to see what they may look like when they disappear and they seemed to get dimmer and then lightly strobe out of sight. No flash no brightness and nothingness just sort of dimmer and dimly disappear. Once again no sound and traveling much faster than any plane would. I spent 16 years as a special forces operator and drove jet boats in my career. I know the normal speed of planes I know direction I also know patterns. I am very observant and try to debunk what I witness first before eliminating possible options. My wife is a nurse was a former Army soldier who worked on Helicopters and has been around aircraft for over 10 years. She is goign to school to be a doctor so she disects things to get to the facts. She agreed that this was no aircraft we spotted. It was not a satellite(s) and was moving quickly and in the same path of each other. Lastly while staring at one particular 'star' object moving through the sky I was trying to compare it to a star it was passing. It would allow me to gain a comparison with the star to dsetermine size and elevation (possibly) and when I did so I noticed that the object was moving in a serpentine way. It was moving along the same path as the others but while moving forward was doing so like a snake moving across the sand. To confirm that my eyesight was not playing tricks I watched the object behind it and the one behind that as it passed the star I was using as my comparison point. It seems that all of these objects were moving in the same manner but from the distance we were viewing it from it was so slight I am sure I would not have noticed that particular pattern if I wasn't trying to compare it to the star. In all I would have to estimate about 30 objects that traveled across the sky last night. As I am a believer who had had an experience as a child I have always looked to the stars for answers and try to approach everything in a scientific manner. These objects were not something I have ever witnessed previously and the speeds traveled was incredible and silent. I was excited to have experienced it. Hopefully others have reported the same sightings to support what I have just mentioned but if not I know what I witnessed. Content-type: text/html,,{cak} Dozens of UFOs,moving star,,"Bessemer,AL "
MUFON,2020-04-15 6:00AM,4/15/20,,Jacksonville,TX ,TEXAS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was out jogging with my dog. I was almost home when I looked up to see a bright line of stars. I thought it was part of the Milky Way until I realized the stars were moving in a straight line traveling SW to NE. Some were single file and some were side by side. It seemed to go on for a long time. There were many of them. I estimate between 50-75. There was no sound. They were all glowing white. They looked like big moving stars. They were moving at a pretty good rate of speed considering how high they were. There were a few stragglers at the end that trailed behind the rest at regular intervals.

They were white balls of light looking like fast moving stars. I didn’t want to miss it but I yelled for my husband to come out and see and prayed I wouldn’t miss anything but they kept on coming. I tried taking video but wasn’t able to capture the entire incredible experience. I was able to zoom on one and then my breath got in the way with the cold air. My heart was pounding out of my chest. I have never been more thankful that my dog had to use the bathroom! He never wakes me up to go and on this evening/morning it was the second time he had to go! My husband thinks he saw flashing lights on them (he claims red and green) but I did not and do not believe they were aircrafts from our earth. I hope and pray there is more evidence of the incredible things I saw in the sky this morning! Afterwards I felt like I was going to throw up. I’ve never in my life and all the times looking in the sky have ever witnessed something like I did tonight. I want to cry. It was truly amazing and my husband obviously needs to be abducted to believe 😕 it was truly unbelievable! I really wish I had more video and that you could see how many there were.

None of them had colored or blinking lights like you would see from a commercial aircraft. Instead they were steady lights much like moving stars. They looked like the occasional satellites that I used to see in the Northwoods; except there was a long string a convoy. I took some video. It was about 7:35pm when I saw the first of about thirty. Only two were close together. The other 28 or so were evenly spaced apart traveling exactly same speed and in the exact same direction and appearing from the exact same place in the southwestern sky – one after another. Hard to gauge their size or altitude or speed; except they were travelling much higher than the commercial air traffic from O’Hare airport.

MUFON,2020-03-26 5:52AM,3/26/20,,Moscow,PA ,PENNSYLVANIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report At about 8:10 PM Eastern we saw a series of 15 to 25 moving lights in the sky in a line moving from southwest to northeast (roughly seemingly in the direction of Portsmouth Ohio (or further away in that direction) towards Chillicothe / Cleveland Ohio). These were solid lights that were fading into view and then faded out of view at a certain point in the sky (no significant clouds in the area) so it appeared as though they were flying from a lower to higher plane / angle as if going into the stratosphere or space. Due to the number of the objects the shock of the experience and way they were fading out we were unable to count the exact number so there could have been many more. 6 people saw this event. The objects were initially mistaken as odd moving stars due to the seeming height and faintness of their lighting. It is possible that at this time the western setting sun could have been reflecting from their bodies and causing this lighting of the many objects. There were 3-5 other flying planes or jets with flashing lights that appeared to be monitoring the situation / flying around the area. There was a sonic boom approximately 30-60 minutes before we saw this. There has been a sonic boom every evening / night this week (sometimes later than this) which is peculiar for this area. The Wright-Patterson Air Force Base resides approximately 250 miles northwest of this region however these objects did not appear to be coming from or going to this location.

Then I realised I was not experiencing vertigo but was observing a series of objects move across the sky. The objects were indistinguishable from stars except that they moved steadily southwest in formation. The first 6 objects consisted of 4 objects in a straight line equidistant from one another the remaining two objects travelled parallel to the 4 and directly across from the 2nd and 3rd objects. The other 20 objects traveled in five groups of four also in a straight line and equidistant from one another. They were higher in the sky than jets (both USAF and commercial). I first observed the ""moving stars"" from my bedroom window then went outside to observe and listen for any sounds they may have made. I could hear a helicopter but it is my belief that the ""moving stars"" were too high to be helicopters. I could hear no other noises from the sky. It is my belief that I was seeing light emitted by objects rather than the objects themselves. The time was a little more than an hour before sunrise and the sky was mostly clear.

There were at least 10 objects in this formation having the brightness magnitude nearly that of Venus. There is no way I could determine the altitude .I assumed it was at least upper atmospheric or higher . They were traveling in a south by south west direction over Beckley wv toward the Kentucky/ Virginia border. They were only in view for less than 20 seconds ! So there speed had to be tremendous.

I noticed what at first looked like a moving star. At first I thought it was a plane but then there was another and another and another. They just kept coming. Perfectly spaced and in a perfect straight line. Maybe 30. I just kept watching. They looked like stars moving in a line. Toward the end a triangle of lights was observed followed by maybe 5 more single lights in the same order as before. They all traveled to a certain point in the sky and dissapeared. Always at that same point. This was not normal air travel. The lights were steady no blinking or colors and the distance between them was always the same and the line of travel was ruler straight. Not real sure about the direction. I was in front of my house and that is where the sun sets and they were traveling to the right east maybe. I do not know what elevation it was.

MUFON,2019-09-17 9:00PM,9/18/19,,Copperas Cove,TX ,TEXAS,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report My son and I were camping at Three Rivers State Park NM. We had spread out a blanket and were lying on our backs after sunset to observe the night sky. We had been watching the sky for over an our and each of us had seen a few shooting stars as well as satellites and aircraft. We were well-oriented to the sky having noted the Big Dipper and North star. We were facing east to keep the crescent moon glare behind us. At about 10:00 shortly after a bright star rose in east-southeast my son called my attention to what appeared to him to be moving stars. In the south or east-southeast between 20 and 30 degrees from horizontal was a triangle of ""stars"" a few degrees wide. Two bight stars to the right were nearly vertical to each other and a dimmer one to the left formed a nearly equilateral triangle. I didn't notice any edge or connection between these ""stars"" other than that they moved together to our left rising to something over 30 degrees. These ""stars"" did not change relationship to each other as they moved. The background stars were clearly visible at all times. The pace of movement was about the rate of a typical satellite crossing the sky. Slowly the ""stars"" faded until we could no longer see them at about the time they were east of us.

I was taking my dog outside when I noticed it. It was very slowly moving across the night sky. There was no noise and the object keep changing colors between white yellow and red! It was moving way to quietly and slowly to be a jet or plane. It was about 1:15/1:20 AM in to the morning. There were no clouds at the time either and I even saw a plane move about this object at the same time. Not sure what I was seeing. Please DO Investigate! Thank you!

MUFON,2019-08-01 2:00AM,8/3/19,,Vancouver,WA ,WASHINGTON,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report I live and work in a very remote all year round campground surrounded by thousands of acres of BLM forest. I first started seeing the lights in the first week of July. I continue to see them every week. I have seen them pulse blink out become very dim or very bright. I have seen more than one at a time. I have seen two change directions at the same time as if I'm watching a choreographed ballet in the sky. I have had one come down over the river between the massive trees on each side and blink twice. I have been able to show them to campers... Who all think I'm talking about satellites until they see them too. I am still in contact with several witnesses who can confirm these sightings. The weirdest one so far was when one night I was visiting with three other campers... I was showing one of them the ""moving stars"" I see. She and I were watching one disappear into the distance when the other two people walked up. At that moment a thick fog rolled in overhead. The girl and I commented that now we won't be able to watch our ufos... Just as I said that the whole sky flashed with a bright light that was gone before you could register it. So the four of us just stand there looking up into the sky... This huge solid circle of light appears on the fog turns off then turns on again but has moved slightly and off. And that was it. We just stood there with our mouths open. One of the campers grumbled something about car headlights and went inside. I and the girl and the girl's father all looked at each other and agreed it was no headlights... We are on one road that leads deep into BLM. Had there been a car pointing straight at the fog above our heads... Well that car would have had to have wings... I continue to see them. Just about any night that I have a good hour to spend looking skywards... I always see them. And it seems that when I invite people to see them with me they always appear and put on a show. I tried taking pictures and video... My phone is awful. I tried a real camera but I can't seem to get a good shot when they look like stars which is most of the time... And when they do something amazing it'sMUFON so amazing I don't think about recording til after the fact... I would love for professionals to come camp for a week with me. I tell people their minds will be blown... And they always leave saying ""that was no satellite!"" I think they like to be shown to people... I would also like to mention that I am 42 years old and an Army veteran. I do not drink or take drugs. I simply believe that they want to be seen and I just thought MUFON would like to know. I don't have cell service out there but can be reached when I go to town. I usually get to town Mondays and Tuesdays to check my email.

MUFON,2019-06-08 10:00PM,6/11/19,,Tularosa,NM ,NEW MEXICO,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report I just booked a Lyft to go see my father downtown. I was standing on the corner of Exeter and Lancaster and while I was waiting I looked up at the construction site next to my work building also on Lancaster St. A star was in view then I noticed it wasn't a star because it was moving. I've tracked and watched the ISS cross the evening sky in the past so I know what that looks like with the naked eye and this was not it. It felt weird because it was moving a lot slower than any high-flying aircraft. I watch them all the time from the harborside as BWI Airport is south from this location. So I see a lot of different sized jets planes even a VTOL Osprey once. I'm an avid believer but seems I only get to see the edge of things for myself so this is exciting that I actually got footage of the object. I say object because i could see someone saying it's a balloon ...or something but it wasn't drifting tilting or spinning from what I could see. It wasn't in a cluster and balloons tend to rise on the wind so there's not a direct path like this thing had. I clicked home twice on my Samsung S8+ which brings up the camera. I tried to keep it centered in the few seconds I could shoot but you can see it twinkle. It wasn't constant or a steady pulse just glinted. You can hear my voice in the video. The only reason I stopped recording was because my lyft arrived. I took a few pics again with the same phone. I'm glad I can actually see it in the pics too. I told my driver what I saw he just said ""really?"". When we passed by Aliceanna I looked up from the backseat and saw it still up there. That's the last I saw of it. If I was standing facing NE then the path of the object had to be SSE maybe? Towards the Chesapeake Bay's mouth? I'm hoping someone on your end can at least analyze the pics and vid to see if it has any shape or detail i couldn't see. Again it looked like a slow-moving star then it seemed metallic and reflective like a round dot ALL the way up there. It didn't seem like a balloon nor plane. I've seen those flying that high and those boys always move fast and usually leave contrails here and there. This was different. Thank you.

MUFON,2018-10-16 1:15AM,10/17/18,,Rochester Hills,MI ,MICHIGAN,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report My girlfriend and I were outside smoking by my car when she pointed out the Big Dipper and other constellations. I was looking up at the light post by my neighbors when I noticed a bright glowing orb that was fading in and out growing brighter not transmitting any sound nor blinking red lights like how an airplane or helicopter would. I told my girlfriend � look !! Do you see that?� She immediately got goosebumps and covered her mouth standing a bit behind me. I ran inside to go get my mother and my cell phone to try and record the strange glowing orb. My girlfriend said that it was moving west and was constantly fading in and out to a point that she thought it completely disappeared. After I ran out I see that the orb is super dim and finally faded away. She tells me how crazy it was to watch because she could easily distinguish the orb from a normal airplane or a helicopter since they were constantly flying around the area. We go back to smoking talking about the orb more and I look back up towards the northern mountains to see the orb back blinking again. This time we both pointed at it and the orb looked like a normal star then seemed to turn towards us and get extremely bright like we�ve seen never before. After getting extremely bright we watch it move towards the NE mountains then quickly fade away into the darkness. We watched for minutes more and didn�t see anymore orbs nor moving stars.

MUFON,2018-09-01 12:00AM,10/15/18,,Coquille,OR ,OREGON,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report This sighting started before I went to work. It was May 29th 2018 around 11:20pm. I went outside to check out the sky. I went to my usual spot back area of our rocky driveway cause its nice and dark back there. It was a very clear night and the moon looked almost full. It was probably 95% full. While looking up at about 80 degrees toward the South-East (slightly more East) direction in the several degrees to the left of the moon I saw a flash of light in my peripheral vision. I looked to where it was but the object was no longer bright. I looked at the stars in the general area where the flash was and then saw a dim star moving around slightly. Reminded me of an insect in how it moved. It hovered but would randomly ""shutter"" around. I believe it was the Lyra constellation. The moving object made a ""triangle"" type shape with the surrounding stars as if it were its own constellation itself. There were two dim stars below it and then the ""top"" of this implied pyramid was the moving star. I noticed that it was very dim as well as dim as the stars below it but would randomly brighten up a little. I then saw in my peripheral vision another flash. I looked to my left toward the North-East direction at about 70 degree angle and saw another UFO. It was dim but still brighter than the stars around it. It would randomly move around like the other object but not as much. I turned my head back toward the South-East at the first object. I went to charge my video camera in hoping of catching the movement. After it charged for about 10min I tried to record the object but it was too dim for my video camera to pick up. I watched the object for about 25mins. Around 11:45pm I went to my backyard area and faced toward the North-East. I saw a bright orange object cross the sky at a cruising speed (not that fast). It was bright orange for about 10 seconds then dimmed to look like all the other dim stars around it. I figured it was a satellite with sunlight gleaming off it but it was unusual anyway. I didnt think much of it since it was likely a satellite but was interesting to watch. At around 11:55pm I went inside my house to make some food for myself before I left for work. I was late for work about 9mins due to me observing these two moving objects. At around 2:11am I went outside to observe the object again. This turned out to be the best sighting of the whole night. I went outside to the grassy area in front of my place of work near two large pine trees. Its dark in that area which is perfect for star-gazing. Night was still very clear like before at my house. My head was pointed up at about 90 degrees and slightly toward the South-East direction. I held the back of my head with my hand to make it easier to tilt my head back for observation. As before there was an implied ""triangle"" shape with the object and its surrounding stars. Bright object at the top of the two dim stars below it making a equilateral triangle shape (if u were to connect the stars with a line). The color of the object bright bluish-white with a little orange mixed in. According to my planetarium program and the position of the object during this time of night this bright object was Vega. But its movements suggested otherwise. Like before at 11:20pm the movement was like an insect switching from motionless hovering to subtle horizontal movement which was erratic while still hovering vertically. After watching I figured it might be a trick of the eyes or the atmosphere so I decided to lay down in the grass as well as give my hand a break from holding my head. I laid in the grass with my body facing down the center of the implied triangle shape of the stars and the object to get the best ""geometric"" view of this implied triangle shape. I figured this would steady my head completely. What I observed was very strange. The bright object would still move around randomly then stop stay motionless then go back to the insect-like erratic movement like small figure-8s and other random ""jumpy"" movements almost jellyfish like. Occasionally the brightness of the object would increase typically during one of these subtle erratic movements. It never changed altitude only moving slightly around horizontally while keeping a steady hover. At one point it moved in a small diagonal line from the top-right to the bottom-left. It seemed to be ""pulled"" by the bottom left star and was ""fighting"" a force that came from the bottom left star as it tried to move in opposite direction away from it. At least that what it appeared like. I watched as this implied triangle changed shape from equilateral to having a more ""squished"" appearance meaning the top moving object moved toward the center of the implied triangle. In comparison to the two lower stars those two dim stars did not move. They were perfectly still. Im glad those stars were right there it made it easier to see any actual movement with the bright star-like object (versus perceived movement from looking at a bright object in the dark). Only the bright object above moved with insect-like erratic random subtle movements. I laid on the ground for about 20minutes looking at it. I was past due on my work break so I got up and went back to work. Last sighting was around 4:54am. I was on my lunch break and decided to check out the object again. Went outside and saw what could have been this object and its where Vega is positioned at that time of the morning at an 85 degree angle toward the West. Sunrise had started but I could still see some bright stars. Just a few thou. One was this object or it was in the same position as the object I saw at 2:11am. I could see subtle movements but couldnt be sure if it was an illusion since the dim stars that were there before were gone (due to the sunlight). And thats the last time I looked at it.

MUFON,2018-08-30 12:10PM,8/30/18,,Harbor East Baltimore Ci,MD ,MARYLAND,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report My friend our two 13 years old daughters and I were up North Wisconsin in the summer far away from major cities therefore sky was so clear and filled with stars and we saw the sky from horizon to horizon we saw couple airplanes and slow moving stars what we called as satellites. Suddenly 4 of us saw two objects that looks like bright stars were going from East through the sky with extraordinary speed like one ""star"" was chasing another and very close to each other on visual field of sky about 1 inch from each other then when they approached about middle of the sky or right above out heads first one without slowing it's speed made about 90 degree turn and one that follow it just stopped right in the center of our visual field. First ""star"" without slowing down flew to North side of the sky until we no longer can see it. We lost track of the Second one as it stopped and mixed up among other stars. To give an estimate how fast they were going that entire event took about 10-13 seconds. I am physician and like to reading about technology and with certainty can say that there are no human made objects that can fly with such speed through sky at very high altitude basically from horizon to horizon for about 10+ seconds make 90 degree turn at such speed and especially make sudden Stop from high speed path. FOUR of us witnessed that event and we all were amazed and recollected about what we had seen. Unfortunately as Murphy law none of us were filming it as we were fascinated looking at what we saw.

Returned to the house and retrieved binoculars. It was very bright star like object to the naked eye. But seen through binoculars it was very bright elongated object with bright green and blue lights which seemed to pulse or blink. The object moved around in a very erratic fashion up down around and hovering for a few minutes then again moved around very quick and abrupt changes in direction. Then noticed a second object just like the first but much lower on the horizon but not as bright and without movement. The brighter object initially looked like a wheel turned on its side with lights on the side but when it moved up or down there was a very defined triangular shape to it with the entire object covered with pulsing or blinking lights. We live in an area next to a nuclear bomb manufacturing facility with airline flight paths overhead every hour or so. When the event began I noticed an aircraft In the far distance. But strangely no other flights for the duration. I also noted what appeared to be 3 or 4 ""shooting stars"" pass right where the object was hovering. The entire event was very strange and unsettling.

MUFON,2017-09-25 7:35PM,9/27/17,,Escondido,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report This extraordinary event of late at night on Friday July 21st 2017 on a hill by the lake at the Saddleback Lake Lodge in Dallas Hill Plt. Near Rangeley ME. A quiet remote and peaceful location. My family rents a cabin on this Lodge every summer and have been doing so for as long as I can remember. Members of my extended family rent adjacent cabins. There is a central field with an elevated grassy hill just up from the lakeshore and in front of the central cabins and right next to the one I was staying in at the time. Here there is an old stone fire pit and several wooden tables. Myself my Father two aunts two uncles and several cousins were all standing around here firepit area and talking. The night sky in this area is especially breathtaking in this area with thousands of stars brightly visible. This was a very clear cool quiet and starlit night and I had been seeing shooting stars on the preceding nights. The time was roughly 11:50pm my eyes had been glanced skyward at the view for a few minutes. One of my aunts pointed to a shooting star and I went to look and missed it but kept my eyes on that area of sky anyway hoping to catch another one (and I'm sure others did as well) it was at this moment out of the corner of my field of vision I noticed an object far brighter and perspectively larger than any star or planet visible or that I have ever seen. This object was bright white and brilliantly shining much more prominent than anything else In the sky. We all noticed it within seconds. The object appeared circular oval or possibly egg shaped but it's shaped was vaguely defined as it was so bright. It appeared to be expanding as it slowly moved and simultaneously grew more brilliant I wasn't sure if the object itself was shifting in shape to or if this was simply light that it was generating or reflecting. I estimated that it appeared around 20 times larger than the largest surrounding stars and many times brighter. It appeared white like a brilliant spotlight but was much different in nature. The UFO seemingly grew to the point where it made a slight flashing or pulsating action before it began to gradually dim and shrink it continued to move in its slow path of orbit to the north. At this moment another shooting star shot by to the southwest while the object was in sight. The objects movement and appearance were much different than the meteoroid. The object continued on its trajectory and gradually dimmed and shrank until it appeared about the size of the surrounding stars and now it appeared to be a more orangish/greenish color it was visible for over 20 seconds max before it disappeared amongst the vast volume of stars and I lost sight of it. The object whatever it was was likely outside of earths atmosphere as it moved at a similar (albeit slightly faster) rate of speed as a satellite and maintained a similar trajectory. We all continued to watch the sky hoping for the bizarre objects reappearance as we all discussed what it possibly could have been. Approximately 10 or so minutes later (and within a minute of two of Midnight) the amazing sight returned. I was the first to spot it and immediately notified everyone. There was the bright light now northeast of its original location and possibly at a farther distance from my vantage point as it appeared marginally smaller than before. However it was traveling in the same direction. Once again it gradually expanded and grew in brightness and intensity as we stood in awe. And then again it made a subtle flashing notion before gradually starting to dim and fade away from my view before disappearing. Now even more baffled and perplexed by the incredible and puzzling sight I began to scan the night sky. I did not catch sight of the object again however about 15 minutes later I noticed a very sudden and quick flash over the trees across the nearby dirt road. I am unsure if this was related to the brilliant light we witnessed shortly before. I am a lifelong aviation enthusiast and an aspiring pilot and Air Show announcer and often have my eyes directed towards the sky on any given day. 95+% of the time I am able to identify what I see and rarely do I have no idea regarding the identity of something I see. I can assure you that this unidentifiable object was not a star given it's movement not a satellite as I have seen those in the night sky before (including several other on the nights leading up to the incident and the night itself) and they usually just appear as looking like a dimmer moving star. Also this object reappeared in a different area of the sky about ten minutes after first being spotted and possibly at a greater distance and I have Been told that it takes 4 hours or more for a satellite to orbit the earth and it always passes by in the exact same section of sky as before. Also I don't think satellites can generate light let alone one powerful and brilliant as what I witnessed and it they can reflect light I doubt it can be seen from that great a distance or make the object appear several times larger. I saw several shooting stars including one while the object was in view and they have entirely different characteristics of movement often being blink and you'll miss it quick occurrences while the object/light was in clear view for over 20 seconds. However the color and brightness of a larger shooting star would be comparable to that of the UFO. I am certain that it was not any man made Aircraft or drone as it possessed no blinking navigational or landing lights emitted absolutely no sound whatsoever and appeared to be outside the atmosphere. I have been coming to this area in Maine my entire life and have seen numerous interesting sights in the sky. From unbelievable meteor showers to fireworks on Saddleback Mtn. To multiple satellites. I've seen Chinese fire lanterns and weather balloons before which do not resemble what I saw I have seen a KC-135 tanker refueling a massive C-5 Galaxy transport at lower altitude around sunset in the area and countless military commercial and general aviation aircraft at varying altitudes and am extremely skilled at identifying the specific types. I've seen the ISS (International Space Station) pass over on two occasions once over Moosehead Lake in 2010 and another time at Camp Roosevelt in 2015 and recognize it as being a reddish colored light slightly larger in appearance but similar in movement and nature to a satellite and is noticeably different. With the knowledge I have attained I have always been somewhat skeptical of then UFO phenomena but have remained interested in it but have only on a few occasions seen objects that I cannot identify but this instance has left me very shaken and puzzled as I have absolutely no explanation for what I have seen. I continued to watch the sky until 1:30am but did not see the object again I decided to write this report as soon as I could while the memory was still fresh in my mind and all the details intact. I will continue to watch the night skies for the remainder of the week. PLEASE do something to investigate this sighting as it involved multiple individuals who all witnessed and described the same exact sequence of events and appearance of the object itself also look into other sightings that were submitted on the same day in the same state or immediate area and see if the descriptions correlate. I stand by that this was one of the most bizarre and bewildering things that I have ever witnessed.

I looked up in wonder and spotted one moving star heading in a northerly direction at a steady pace from from the South East direction. No sound not a plane one light steady pace and it took about 2 minutes to fly into the distance until I couldn't see it anymore. It DID NOT disappear.

As I looked to the South I noticed a Fast moving Star light over 14 500 mph towards the north then changed direction to the East as quickly as it appeared another star light appeared as the one launched a weapon the east then moving light quickly turns around towards newly witnessed light . As then a loud Earth shaking Boom came from a weapon fired as Blue flaming reaentry Piece came quickly back to Earth and burned up in the Far West horizon. As then out of nowhere I looked at a Deep dark ort cloud or Dark Matter or possibly a black hole directly from Cassiopeia. Then the Fast moving then light moving directly South sparkles with gold flashes and is gone. My opinion for what I smelled yes I could smell the Dark matter. Almost like burnt pieces of firewood . Strong sense that the lighted spacecraft used binary star systems to hyper leap through time to reach Earth as the battle i witnessed was a once and lifetime experience. Days leading up this the moon is also a main key to this event battle or war between other alien planets . 7 days leading up to the event I did witness many times star like lights moving 14 500 mph directly overhead traveling North too South as if to capture charged plasma from above Earth to refuel their ships.

So since I was awake in bed with the sliding glass door open I had an excellent view of the stars on a very clear night. There were many big stars and small stars. Upon looking at the stars I noticed that a couple of the smaller ones appeared to be moving and in vey strange ways. Like looping and stopping and hovering and then glowing and zooming off again. After clearing my eyes a couple times I decided to take my iphone out on the deck and hold it up in an attempt to record the moving star like objects. I held the iphone up with two hands above my head after pushing record. I waited about a minute and stopped recording as the screen was black I could not see what I was recording.

I was kind of panicking because it seemed the stars where coming too life around this time I witnessed yet another moving star but different as it was super bright then gone and then light up again and continued with this behavior from the west to the east. About ten minutes later the sky was heavily trafficked with airplanes flying in pairs crisscrossing the sky in all directions! It seemed as if they where looking for something and I assumed it was military!

I saw normal stars then all the sudden a red dot appeared as if you flicked a switch and a light turned on. It was the size of your average star but it was bright red. It was stationary for 2 seconds then slowly but fluidly began to move across the sky leaving no trail. It picked up speed then it broke into 2 dots both looked the same and still a red dot like star. It then made 3 figure 8 shapes and at the 3rd figure 8 when it came back together it dissapeared. I remember yelling ""WHOA""!!! and my friends asking me what happened.

They were all over the sky - some straight up as you look in the sky some a little to the east some a little to the western sky near and around Orion's . There were larger ships that would move more in a path and smaller ships that looked like they were firing at the larger ships or at each other. The smaller ships would sometimes in formation then split off and some would do circles around the larger ships or zip in and around the sky. One ship was shot and began to fall like a fireball in the sky. My phone camera couldn't really capture anything -- it was happening so far away and so fast and they just look like stars bouncing around and firing at each other.

MUFON,1965-05-30 1:00AM,12/11/20,,Denison,TX ,TEXAS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Started out as bright beams of light shining through my bedroom window at night. The beams of light we’re moving back-and-forth I’m very bright on my wall. I looked out my bedroom window to see what it was and I saw a bright glowing orb of white lights in my woods and it was moving back-and-forth. Then it started turning on and off like it noticed me watching it. It would move back-and-forth it could flash really brightly could make a strobe light effect it did all kinds of weird things. I noticed two more of them three of them total in triangle shape. Over the next entire week I started going outside in my yard and looking out into the woods and in the field beside my house. Started seeing the same three orbs coming from the south east also saw bright glowing orange orbs coming up thru the woods. Strange lights would appear in the field. Usually three bright orbs in a triangle shape. I finally noticed when I was out one night that the three glowing orbs are actually coming from three other glowing orbs way up in the sky. They look like stars but they were moving and also in the shape of a triangle. And you can tell that the three orbs way up in the sky were all part of the same thing because they all moved together. you could see beams of light coming off of them like the orbs up in the sky were shining beams down closer to the ground creating the orbs that I see in the woods and field. And it seemed like the more I went out there looking for these things and trying to figure it out The more activity happened and got much more intense. The last night I went out looking for these things they started coming out from every direction I looked at. Like whatever was up in the sky could project the orbs anywhere it wanted.

They appeared translucent like jelly fish. I knew they werent solid like a craft or balloon but were more like light but with definite shape. At dark they were gone.

There were two large orbs around these flashing lights. They looked like stars at first but with binoculars they were clearly round disk shaped orbs. They were very large and stayed in the same place at a fixed distance from each other. They appeared to only move because of the earth turning. All my neighbors seen this and we all agreed it was crazy to see! As I started recording they got higher in the atmosphere. But they didn’t float away. They were directly above our houses and by an hour time passing they were still visible just slightly further south. A large flash of light flew near them and scared all of us. A military plane flew by before we witnessed this. We also seen a few non flashing lights that looked like Satellites but they were weaving in and out 3 in the same direction at once.

MUFON,2020-08-14 10:04AM,8/22/20,,Pembroke pines,FL ,FLORIDA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I walked outside to talk to my mom one the phone. I looked to my left and saw a planet like star. I’m an amateur astronomer and was extremely curious of what planet it was because it was out of place. I looked at it and it started moving side to side and went down below the tree line I immediately knew it wasn’t a planet or a star. I went to look further a saw a second one then a third one I began to scream in my mom’s ear on the phone “Mom there’s 3 ufos out here.” I called my wife to come outside quickly to see what I was seeing. She began to open her camera app on her phone while my 12 year old daughter was setting my telescope down on the ground. I was in total awe. Suddenly one flew over our heads a tremendous speed I mean it was gone. I believe that it was that particular one that came back up into the field of view by this time all 7 of my family members were outside seeing this thing fly off into the distance. We struggled getting it on camera it wasn’t picking it up at first. We then noticed another one directly over head and it began flying slowly in the opposite direction and stopped and appeared to be coming down in the area behind my house. The lights would flash and then go dark and randomly come back on and go back out again. While the lights was out I could make out circular shape silhouette that appeared to be coming down. That was the last we saw of them. This all went on for about 7 minutes. My wife was able to capture footage of at least two but after further investigation of the video it looks like there were more than two. The one at the top of video at the very beginning fly’s to the right and zips off at a 45 degree angle out of the picture while the other stayed hovering around a moving with changes of direction. The one that flew away seemed to have come back and fly’s in a half circle around the other and off to the left. It comes back again stops and changes direction again.

MUFON,2020-08-15 8:15PM,8/17/20,,premont,TX ,TEXAS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Since July 21 nearly every day Various jets and airplanes spotted periodically with more frequent black triangle crafts with white and red blinking lights and white orbs appearing that appear like stars and stationary but that vibrate and can follow one another or move individually and can speed off leaving a white cloud trail. The black crafts can change direction in flight very abruptly ascend descend change speeds quickly and stop in the air or fly with fast speed. I have Seen a large aircraft with white red and green light that seems to have a team of black triangles not seemingly in formation. Also have seen various jets that tend to cause my head to feel weird and mess with The tv signal and I think the radio and maybe Cell phone. Saw a jet Several times over these days that has white led bars on the bottom Or long white lights. None of the jets or aircraft's fly with headlights and I think some fly with no lights. I see from dusk till dawn but more prominent late night into early morning like 9pm to 5 am. Clouds often show when these things appear and have seen rain and lightning. But cloudy definitely! Also seen in the cloud breaks. Looks like the Sahara dust cloud kinda with pink sunset sorta and general brown or dark low hanging clouds. These crafts fly in low altitude as well as seemingly higher. I have seen one triangle stop in mid air above tree line sit for a moment and disappear into a cloud that seemingly appeared Around it. It looked like it landed quickly but i have seen others take off very fast from a stopped position leaving a long thin cloud trail. Some neighbors have seen these too and felt spooked. The animals are also acting strange. Deer are more friendly bats are as well. Birds are flying disorganized as well as insects. I saw a skunk who didn’t notice me and was burrowing near the street and walked right past it closely without it noticing me which was unusual. Bats have flown near me. Birds fly back and forth like they don’t know where to go as well as moths and possibly hummingbirds at night. I haven’t seen the animals behaving like this in this neighborhood until recently. We recently had 5g installed and is still being developed here which is when I noticed more of these. Several military crafts in the months prior to. I hear frequent hums swooshes and aircraft's flying. Also the white orbs tend to just float overhead but they reflect light I think and are like floating capsules or satellites or something maybe drones. Very wild stuff and interesting experiencing all this. Camera would frequently go fuzzy looking at many crafts and some crafts would appear as white orbs with bright light dot in the center but did not appear as such to the naked eye.

The three just set there and after a few minutes my dad came in and I told him to look at the three stars. He looked and I told him what happened and he just said they are stars they never moved while he looked at them for a few minutes. He left the room and I asked if I could keep watching and he said ok. I watched them for maybe another 25 minutes and then the three moved in formation like the satellites did across the sky down to the horizon like I had seen satellites do in the past. I know this is not exciting but over the years I have never been able to figure out what I saw especially back in the 60s and the speeds that made me thing meteor before the just stopped. Your question I had to answer some I can not tell as this looked like they where in orbit and I had no way to tell any detail. Just how they moved and they just looked like stars ot little white dots. Content-type: text/html,,6 to 8 bright lights over the Camp Pendleton Marine Base.,like star,,"Oceanside,CA "
MUFON,2020-07-21 9:45PM,7/21/20,,Mission,TX ,TEXAS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report On July 2nd at 4pm on a very sunny day with just a couple clouds I saw something strange in the sky that looked like stars. There were about 4-5 of them lined up in a star like pattern. Frustrated with poor quality iPhone photos I went inside my shop and got my HD Canon camera 210 mm telephoto lens and Tripod. Once I got a good photo I knew I was looking at something out of this world. I could only really see it with the telephoto lens. To my eyes it just looked like a dot. So I started taking as many photos and video as I could. I was able to take photographs of two UAP’s. The first was further away and the second was closer. The closest one was the easiest to film. Once I started filming it I could see the object was slowly drifting to the East. Maintaining the same elevation it looked like. It drifted slower than the occasional cloud that drifted by. You can see this in the video. Fortunately I filmed the object centered in between a telephone wire and telephone pole was a sense of distance and size. I filmed until my camera died at 4:31 pm. The objects were still slowly drifting just north of town when I had to go back to work. They were gone when I was done with work at 5. I learned more about the object while editing the photos and videos in post. In adobe premiere I was able to zoom in enough on the object to see that it was rotating pulsing changing shape slightly morphing etc. I made a video and have just recently uploaded it to YouTube. I document my experience as best I can in the vid and show all the photos and videos I took. It was in the editing process that I realized this could be one of the tic tac ufos. The thing sounds like the pilots describe. I would appreciate y’all investigating this further.

MUFON,1970-07-01 9:00PM,7/18/20,,Portland Maine,ME ,MAINE,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report ive been meaning to make a report since january but with me having my 3rd child under 5 in march and the world events unfolding i simply havent gotten around to it until now...so heres whats goin on: because my children are young i have to go to the back deck behind my house to smoke and at night i have a paranoia about people being to be able to see me while i cant see them at night so i prefer to kill the outside lights and smoke in the dark. naturally i end up there a minimum of about once an hour and i usually turn in around midnight or so when i decide to go to bed. so as you can probly gather i do alot of looking at the night sky in the meantime. so since january ive been noticing what look like stars of varying brightness color and areas of the sky are constantly doing jutting fast paced back and forth zig-zagging and randomness in my sky almost nightly since then. they dont always move fast but some do. some switch and change direction- some do slight drifts for a time and then move more definetly. whats strange is they seem to be trying to convince whoever might be looking that they are stars. but stars dont move in front of your eyes right? from the constant viewing of the sky i know the regular features such as prominent constillations certain planets being in view etc. because i see them nightly. but then there are these ""stars"" that definetly are not actually stars because stars cant do what these are doing.in fact im quite positive if these were manned aircraft the maneuvers would liquify a humans organs.. since i noticed it was reoccuring almost nightly with these things being in the sky i have done about as much research video watching studying other peoples reports and everyother thing i can to compare what im seeing to what other people consider a U.F.O. event and its definetly something strange happening in my sky. alot of people who are into the ufo culture strive to see even one unexplained happening while it seems my part of the sky is some sort of hotbed of weird stuff happening and i think is worth someone who may be able to observe it with actual equipment setup for that sort of thing taking a closer look at because while ive seen the entire spectrum of unbelievable to almost undeniable evidence when it comes to this phenomenon ive yet to hear of a place that has almost constant activity. ive showed several of my friends a few family members. most (i assume) think im just silly in the head but after a while ive got a few people to shutup and actually observe and this stuff is definetly happening and im fortunately seemingly a sane person. what is unfortunate is noone seems to give a crap and they explain it off as sattelites or whatever. i can see satellites too but they almost always have a constant speed and general direction they orbit and are very obviously different than what im seeing. i honestly cant say with any certainty what im actually seeing because who really knows? but ive concluded that they are mostly above an altitude that planes fly are too numerous and wouldnt make sense if they were drones of some sort because just a little bit ago i counted in excess of ten that i can see moving around just tonight and if im wrong thats a hell of alot of drones for no particular reason not having any indicating lights and seem unaffected by any wind that might be happening. i dont believe they are planes because alot of times they change direction instead of making any arcs and have no blinking lights unless the ""star"" itself blinks out and on (which has happened a few times but not regularly). ive seen a few videos that are similar but usually people see one or two lights while mine are usually a minimum of 5 in different areas of the sky. i realize i live in a rural town on the edge of it and my back yard/field points away from the towns lights and maybe i am getting less light pollution than some and may be part of why i seem to be the only one seeing them but even so they seem rather obvious and not really hiding the fact theres something strange afoot. it irks me since ive not heard anyone but me care about it.also alot of times ill see two of the lights moving in tandem-one brighter than most and the other dimmer than regular stars and i think they move in unison possibly because its one object/aircraft/whatever and the lights might be on the outsides somehow but thats speculation honestly. i have no idea what im seeing and not prone to jumping to conclusions on stuff like this and would say im a skeptic who believes nobody knows exactly whats happening but one thing is for sure; SOMETHING is going on and if its IS aircraft our people have no control over and are outpaced by in modern and state of the art machinery im aware of the airforce and aviators in general use its just a good thing whatever it or they are are not hostile. because this would be the a huge national security threat potentially. to pretend this phenomenon isnt happening in front of me would be lying to myself and i would really like someone who cares to see what im seeing to have a look and possibly get some evidence people can view. unfortunately im rather poor and limited to a cheap phone camera but im super confident that if i had a full spectrum camera of any quality i could blow some peoples minds compared to similar incidents ive read or watched online. hopefully someone will hear me and be interested to take a look and can tell me its as crazy a deal as i think it is and not to just ignore it. either way im sure it will continue as it has been since noone around here seems capable of looking up from their phones to see something anymore or simply dont recognize or care about it. thanks for hearing me either way and whoever reads this please know im super lazy and to type this means its something i care about and believe in. thank you Content-type: text/html",,1 object then joined by 2 more.,like star,,"Portland Maine,ME "

She noticed them first and told me to look up. I looked up and saw round shapes that glowed like stars moving very slow in an almost perfect pearl necklace row one just after the other. They seemed to be perfectly spaced apart all going the same speed. We were both in awe and by the end I was shaking. We tried to take a photo but the phone did not record any of the three photos I took. No sound was heard and nothing was emitted from the back.

We were taking a walk in his neighborhood. Nobody else was out. I saw what I thought was a plane on decent into Dallas Love Field until I recognized it was solid orange because it was on fire. Three burning flames in rectangular shape traveling horizontally in the night sky east to west one after the other. There was one followed by the second and then the third seconds apart and on the exact same path. They didn't appear huge but certainly NOT small.. Seconds later we looked back at the night sky and at a much higher altitude were three dim white ""star like"" lights right behind each other spaced somewhat far apart traveling horizontally aligned in perfect formation also traveling east to west. If they had been stationary you would have just been seeing what looked like stars. They traveled quickly together across the sky and continued on until out of our range of sight. I knew being over a major city we would certainly hear what is was on the news the next day. Have given it enough time and have not heard any mention of this which I find quite amazing! I just want an explanation. P.S. I was so damn mad that I left my cell phone at my friend's house as the battery was about shot anyhow. He did not have his either.

MUFON,2020-06-20 3:15AM,6/20/20,,Bath,ME ,MAINE,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report To begin with keep in mind that this is the evening of Sept. 11th 2001. Earlier in the day were the terror attacks and all commercial aircraft were grounded. At this time in my life I was working overnights at a bakery and so I sleep during the day. This particular day I went to bed later than usual because I was watching the TV coverage of the attacks. I woke up around 6pm made some food and watched the sunset. I didn't have to go to work this particular night so I stayed home thinking about the day's events and what that meant for living a ""normal"" life again. I looked out my back door and noticed how the sky seemed exceptionally clear when it occurred to me that this is what it probably looked like to our ancestors and how I've never seen a night sky without aircraft flying through it. I did notice a few satellites passing by but they were not really that noticeable. I found a sense of calm and peace that I was seeking and decided to take a walk to make this moment last as long as possible. I had planned to walk in the neighborhood and started walking along the streets and sidewalks. But while I was ""meditating"" (deep in thought while walking) I felt compelled to walk in a different direction. I initially tried to ignore it but eventually I chose to walk into the woods. At night. Without a flashlight. I had never gone into the woods after dark without two sources of light before and now I was going spontaneously with nothing. I really don't know why I chose to do this other than I felt compelled to go and ended up deciding to go. I didn't actually hear any voices but yet I felt like I was being communicated with - as if being told in my mind that if I didn't go I would miss out on something special. I hiked the woods and trails frequently and so I knew my way around. The darkness was still disorienting though. Eventually I reached a clearing and decided to look up at the stars again. That's when I happened to notice a greenish streak in the sky. It looked like a shooting star except this one was green light and not the normal white flash and streak. And this one seemed to last about three time longer than what I usually see when I see shooting stars. And it seemed a lot closer to the ground than the ones way up high. From my point of view it went behind the limb of the mountain but then 2 seconds later there was a huge flash in the sky from the direction it was heading. A few moments later I heard a clap of thunder and wondered if the streak had crashed or exploded in the air or something. And so I began to hike deeper into the woods and upwards to get around the mountain to see if I could see anything else. After about 15 minutes I came to another clearing and looked around trying to see if there might be flames or a response from emergency crews. Nothing! As if nothing happened. So I looked to the sky again to try to get my bearings as I was now in a part of the woods and trail system that I was unfamiliar with and to try to approximate where the green streak might have been headed and/or crashed. And this time while I was looking up I noted three stars nearly in a perfect triangle formation but not quite perfectly spaced moving overhead. My first thought was more satellites but then I noticed that the stars behind it would ever so briefly flicker as the edges of the triangle would pass. It seemed odd so I kept watching. As the formation kept moving the stars would flicker as the formation went through them. After a few minutes I had to conclude that it wasn't satellites but a solid object with edges. Yet I couldn't see any actual object other than these three ""stars"" that were near the three points of the triangle shape. It was almost as if the craft were invisible with the only clues it was even there being the three white lights that looked like stars and the flickering of the stars as the assumed edges of the triangle caused the starlight to briefly flicker. When it was directly overhead I was thinking I should have heard some noise or sounds of propulsion or something right? Nope. It was completely silent. I immediately assumed that it had to be military aircraft as those were the only craft allowed to fly in our airspace that night but then again it wasn't like anything I had ever heard about or seen before. After I watched the ""craft"" continue southward and then over the horizon I decided to look once more for signs of a fire or response from the authorities if the green flash had indeed crashed into the mountain or ground. Nothing. But then I noticed a blue flash similar to the green one flash across the sky and on past the northern horizon. Maybe it was a secret military craft. I really don't know. But it was odd how I felt compelled to go into the woods with the thought that I was going to witness something amazing. And then I witnessed these things. Perhaps the two shooting stars were just a coincidence? Perhaps. Or maybe they had something to do with the ""invisible"" triangle? I don't know. But I've since learned about these triangular crafts from other people and sometimes they're described as being black other times as cloaked. Then in the last year or so I was reading an article about how it could be theoretically possible for a spy plane to project an image from above itself to the underside of the craft so that it would look nearly invisible to an observer under the craft. I've decided others may benefit from my experience just as I benefited from others who shared their experiences with me. So I'm now filing this report almost 19 years later. Who knows maybe other people saw this too or saw the green streak explode/crash? Content-type: text/html",,12 to 15 objects traveling in a straight line heading NE,like star,,"Bath,ME "

It knew that I was watching it and would go up and come forward to investigate. Lasted 5 hours. When storm ended there were 2 lights left that looked like stars. They were not. They eventually disappeared. The next night no clouds but the 2 lights that looked like stars were moving in small movements. Not enough to alarm anyone.

MUFON,2020-05-30 10:00PM,6/16/20,,Garland,TX ,TEXAS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I grew up living on Lake Erie as my back yard between three major power plants (two nuclear one coal) my house sits. My dad and I use to star gaze every chance we got so we know placement of the stars pretty accurately. But this night a bright what looked like star appeared as if out of thin air. It was out over the lake just sitting and hovering. There was no movement or sound. We sat and watched it for about an hour. It just sat still with the bright light illuminating it. Then after about an hour you could see the vibration of the light as if it started an engine but you could not hear anything. All of a sudden it did what seemed like a warp speed sideways and out as if into the black unknown. About 3-4 weeks later I laid out at my friends house about 4 blocks from my house star gazing with her and her aunt. The same light showed up above us in the same manor as it did with my dad. We watched it for about 20-30 minutes and it did same thing and warp speed away as if out into the universe. I was around 15-16 at the time. Fast forward 10 years later I am diagnosed with fast acting and aggressive papillary thyroid cancer. 6 months after my dad died from cancer. Now papillary thyroid cancer is neither fast forming or aggressive except for mine. They said I was exposed to radiation at higher levels in some point in my life. I never been around any form of radiation except living between the two nuclear plants. Curiosity makes me wonder if it’s from the plants or the two strange encounters I had! But if it was from the plants wouldn’t there be more than just myself with this type of cancer?

MUFON,2001-09-11 8:30PM,6/15/20,,Flagstaff,AZ ,ARIZONA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report While star gazing on my balcony you can see a pretty good slice of the night sky. Within the visible stars is Orion's belt. This didn't seem to play into this story all that much until a revelation I had. Almost any night the stars are out and there is a clear sky you are bound to see something unexpected unexplainable and quite mind boggling. From stars that move to red or white orb or orb things that look like stars that move. Possibly foo fighters. They are not planes as planes have the distinct and constant flash of their lights. They are not satellites because they do not go in a straight line and dissapear out of sight. I have seen star like object move like a plane or satellite then turn direction too quick or it look like a zig zag motion. Then I thought of quasar flashes or visible to the eye deaths of stars planets universe's and so on. Yet sometimes there's nothing but stars and then you can see a flash and a star appears and then that star that appears starts to move. If payed attention to and followed by the eye it is visible moving weirdly until it dissapears only to flash and reappear in a close by section of the sky and continue on its journey. Things flash inconsistent and move too quick and sharp to be a plane or helicopter. This is where things get too un easy for me. While bugging out seeing the sky alive smoking a cigarette I started to think about the ancient places that were in alignment with Orion's belt. There are three close by churches in the village I live in. These three churches are also aligned with Orion's belt. It is easily visible on Google Earth. I literally downloaded the Google Earth app and went nuts. The church across the street from where I live is exactly one block away from another church a straight line. Steaple to steaple. There is also a church off set to the left of the second church slightly less then a block away. The village of Phoenix is somewhat small so the scale seems weird but zoomed out they are later out just like the pyramids of Giza and many other ancient places aligned with the belt of Orion. Now I'm not sure if this is a coincidence just my brain making something of nothing or the reason for such a visibly active night sky on most nights. One thing is for sure is that I and my girlfriend included have seen unexplainable and unidentifiable things in the night sky of Phoenix New York. Please Google Earth the church on lock street in Phoenix and get our own veiw of the churches. I have been seeing things in the sky my whole life and think I may be on to something with these churches. I've done a rough sketch of the aireal veiw from Google Earth. As well as jotted down breif history facts on the village. Please use Google Earth to get the full sense of it. Content-type: text/html,,Green streak in sky,like star,,"Flagstaff,AZ "
MUFON,12:00AM,6/4/20,,Rapid City,SD ,SOUTH DAKOTA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report At home with my brother outside on my deck star gazing around 9:00pm on March 27 2020 my brother and I witnessed approximately 14 tiny shapes very high in the night sky following the same path from West to East. There was no deviation in direction or speed that we could tell. We also saw a satellite pass by above these 14 objects that were extremely lighted up like stars. The satellite crossed it’s path from a northerly direction. I assumed the satellite was higher as it was much slower in speed than the objects we saw. They were each visible for about 10-15 seconds each. I’m a Pilot and work in Aviation all my life and cannot explain what we saw but they were not aircraft of any kind nor military exercises. The altitude seemed like low orbit definitely higher than any aircraft. Rockets don’t follow each other at least not 14...nor do satellites that I know of and I’ve never seen more than a couple in the nite at one time. Lost for words. I tried using binoculars on each object which were just fuzzy lights moving extremely fast! Did anyone else see what we saw that night? - This is not fabricated.

MUFON,1998-07-15 11:30PM,6/1/20,,Frenchtown Township,MI ,MICHIGAN,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I wanted to get a decent picture of Jupiter and Mars this morning but there was too much cloud cover to see either planet with the naked eye. I was getting ready to pack up my stuff when I saw a flash in the sky like a meteor. Then I sort of saw another one but there's a decent cloud cover so I thought I might have just seen a star through a small break in the clouds those two flashes are the only things I actually saw all the lights in the video I assume were completely covered by clouds I sure couldn't see them. There's four or five lights that seem to travel the same path sort of like Starlink but the angle and direction they're traveling in are totally off for something like a satellite. At 2:08 right after the screen goes blank for a second (I think I walked in front of the camera by accident I was moving around trying to see whatever my camera was seeing) the last one shows up but instead of moving in the same straight line it suddenly takes a FAST sharply angled turn then continues on it's way down. The video quality isn't the best I was too preoccupied with trying to see these things with my own eyes to fiddle around with the settings on my phone so I'm sending both the original and a version with better exposure and sharpness and no audio. One of my favorite things to do is capturing cool stuff that happens in the night sky I got a really awesome shot of Venus' conjunction with the Pleaides Cluster a couple of months ago a great one of the ISS sailing in between Saturn and Jupiter last week. I know how to take night pictures and I've never seen anything like this before. Thank you for your time and if there is a non-freaky explanation for this . It would be huge relief to me.

MUFON,2020-05-25 1:00AM,5/27/20,,Phoenix,NY ,NEW YORK,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Strange Objects in the Sky! April 30 around 9:15 PM a friend called asking me to go outside and look toward the moon and if I can see what she is seeing (12 miles away). I went outside looked up and saw a bunch of mini lights like stars traveling in a straight line. They were far higher and faster than airplanes. Looking toward the moon from where I was standing the objects were oriented lower left of the moon traveling southwest. I called my friend back and we both compare what we saw. Since she was already outside walking her dog she was able to observe the objects longer than me. She counted around 56.

I look over to see what I thought was just reflective space debris moving across the sky when I noticed another one was following shortly behind it and then I look again and another and another till I counted 14 separate objects moving across the sky in a straight line following each other with the same amount of distance between each other.. this was intelligence and cannot be replicated naturally.. moving from north to south.. only about an hour after sunset.. this was no airplanes.. no helicopters.. it couldn't be just space debris.. I do believe it was up above our atmosphere though.. I didn't see lights.. I saw the reflection from sunlight on it.. like space debris but definitely not because they had a intelligent trajectory.. if it was two or three objects.. I would have wrote it off as just space debris.. 14 separate objects!! There is intelligence there.. I've always paid attention to the sky and stars my whole life.. always knowing there is something out there bigger then us.. for me.. last night proved it.. I'll never forget what I saw.. I just wish I had my phone out there with us.. I wanted to run in the house to get it but I knew that by the time I got back they would be to far for my phone camera to pick up and I would have missed witnessing the phenomenon for myself..

As the last one disappeared their was an apparent aircraft flying lower then the appearance of the moon in a northerly direction aircraft was audible. The sky was clear to the west of my property but severe thunderstorms with lots lightning to the east winds were approximately 30-40 miles per hour with higher gusts. I can’t believe what I saw. Makes no sense. Unless they launched multiple satellites. I live very near SAFB. I’m puzzled. I’m hoping someone else saw these lights and I’m looking for an explanation.

MUFON,2020-04-27 9:00PM,4/27/20,,Barto,PA ,PENNSYLVANIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report It was around twilight when me and a group of friends were at a july fourth party at his parents house. We had some girls with us and we were on the side of the house with blankets and towels down on the ground to sit on and we were with our girls stargazing and chatting like typical teenagers do at the time. We all were around 15 or 16 years old at the time of this event. Well while we were all looking up at the sky we all noticed this object in the sky that i can only describe as two stars connected by a line as in if you were to hold your hand up to the sky and put your thumb and finger a half inch apart thats how high up in the aky it was and i would say higher than a plane because they were as i said looking like a star with a thick white line connecting to the other star. @------@ something like that but they were white and they started off really bright and over several minutes it slowly moved in the sky at a very slow pace then it sort of shuddered or vibrated and faded a little bit and then shot off at tremendously high speeds leaving a small trail behind which faded after seconds. It was like it shot off into hyperspace like star wars or something. Later on we called the air force base that is nearby and asked if there were planes in the sky and they informed me that there was not. And the firework display ended at 7ish that night and we knew it was not a plane because there were no indications of that or a satellite. We all saw it and tried to debunk it throughout the years but there was nothing that i or my friends know of that looks like that or did what that object did.

She had been observing what she thought were stars at first but she noticed they were moving in a straight line evenly spaced from NW to SE. I saw it also they were going over the house but were far away and looked almost like stars. I got my phone to video them. The camera didn’t pick up the ones farther away but it picked up the closest one. I screen shot the object from the video and enlarged it and it was egg shaped and seems to have lights on the side. There was a dark area in the middle and also toward the pointed end. It also seemed to pulsate. There was also a large very bright light in the sky and when I zoomed on that it looked like a spinning saucer like object which pulsates and had a dark center and ring. My sister also saw other lights darting around in the sky They looked like circular grey see through discs moving side by side through the sky then they disappeared over the house and she went through the house to see them but they were gone.

I saw a black object just above the tree line out of the corner of my eye that I assumed was an Ultralight so I kept going and went inside. I said something to my mom who was around the house and she took a look at it and she came and got me and said she didn't know what it was. We both went outside and saw a large main rectangular section with two lower units hovering below. The object approached us at a distance and had one blinking red light. We couldn't understand what we were seeing and the object/objects made no noise. I went into the house to grab my phone (it was on low battery) and the recording is what you see on the attached file. Shortly after my phone died. The object stayed stationary for (10-15) minutes and then drifted at the same altitude going west.

MUFON,2021-01-17 1:18PM,3/18/21,,Lees Summit,MO ,MISSOURI,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report Hello my name is [name removed] and I'm not really sure if I'm speaking with the right person or if possibly you can direct me to the appropriate person. To start off I would like to say I have lived in Phoenix Arizona since I was 10 years old but only recently moved to Mesa this last year. Two years ago I knew for a fact aliens were not real and I knew this because of my Christian foundation. Since moving to Mesa and working night shift 4am to 4pm I constantly have my eyes in the sky so much so that I know exactly what I'm looking at and where to look for it. Every night without fail I see multiple ""UFOs"" with a triangular pattern. There are multiple lights in different areas of the sky each and every night. These lights don't move across the sky quickly like most people who claim to see UFOs usually observe but rather slowly as if they're searching or keeping watch. Also they're massive in size although I have nothing to compare it to it spans quite a few hundred feet across the sky. While each and every star slowly moves westward across the night sky the star like lights I observe go north south east west which tells me it cannot be a satellite. From my observation these UFOs are within our atmosphere but usually higher than the clouds but last night was different last night I was terrified by how close it came to the ground. It was still above the power lines but lower than most clouds would be in the sky. There weren't many clouds out last night but there were a few small drifting ones. I need help or was wondering if it would be possible for me to talk to someone and possibly have them come out to my house to see what I see. I know if someone came they would surely observe something strange and or unexplained. I have never reached out to anyone like I am now but I am at a loss for words even if I did right an entire paragraph. Again my name's [name removed] and my number is [removed] and I don't expect you to show up or to even respond to be honest but my address [removed address]. Thank you for your time.

MUFON,2021-03-18 6:15AM,3/18/21,,Minot,ND ,NORTH DAKOTA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was outside having a cigar. When I noticed to the south an object with a straight line of 6 lights. The pattern was 2 white lights one red one green and then 2 white lights. it was about 2 miles away moving so slow that I thought it was going to fall out of the sky. There was no noise which I thought strange. I can hear a prop plane easily at that distance. The lights never changed in ant way. I watched for about 8 minutes when it just disappeared. I cannot give an exact size. But I do estimate that the lights were at least 100- 150 ft. across. I have seen a lot of things star gazing but never anything like that.

It looked like it was falling I thought it was a star at first then realized it was to low for a star. As we got closer to the object in the sky we began to see three lights flashing weirdly in a straight horizontal line. (Red white and green) by this time we were close enough to see the object just sitting there no movement. We stopped in the middle of the road to get a better look up. We were under it and the bottom looked like a circle and it was a dark grey color. It was very low for a plane. We figured stopping in the road was not a smart idea so we pulled in a driveway. (weirdly no one was out on the roads at this time)I was more interested to see what it was so I rolled my window down to take a picture with my phone and the I minute I pulled out my camera it took off. When this thing took off it made NO NOISE. Just gone with the wind. I’ve heard planes in the area and every single on makes me look up because it’s loud passing by.

MUFON,2021-03-13 10:30PM,3/16/21,,Canandaigua,NY ,NEW YORK,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I've been watching hours every single night for over a week now. I've seen orange orbs a few times and they come into our yard and have came toward us 2 times now. The orb darted straight for the white with blue lights ufo that is very large as if to intimidate it. It missed hitting the ufo by a hair and then swooped upward and went rite above our house and just sat there. The orbs appear as orange stars and then they slowly creep towards the white big ufo and or they light up and fly all around. There's multiple of them. I've seen a white huge odd streak that bounced horizontally across the sky near the UFOs and looked super animated and have researched for a solid week plus and have yet to find any explanation for what the white with blue lights is. It has split in 2. It emits something into the atmosphere. It has light beams at times. It has changed the colors of its lights. Last night I swear I saw a extra terrestrial life form running through our yard rite out my big kitchen window . I've had all my kids hubby neighbors whom are both adults all see them as well and said it's not normal or air planes or drones. We've seen lights all through the woods as well. I don't know who to tell this to or where to report it. I've came close to calling state police. I desperately need somebody to come take a look and we've watched them solid hours and catch all kinds of weird things. A orange orb came rite between to huge trees and they're probably 80 ish foot tall trees and the orb came half way up that tree and had absolutely no sound no blinking lights. we've seen them at the tree line a lot and go down under the tree line which made me wonder if it landed. But one night we all saw one on the ground in the woods and I had 4 other ppl see it as well. please help I have 4 kids 2 whom are very scared .

MUFON,2021-02-25 2:47AM,3/15/21,,Winchester,NH ,NEW HAMPSHIRE,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I went on the balcony 4th floor at 3am. I thought my dog locked me on the balcony from jumping on the door trying to get out as i tried to get in when my phone died. Not sure what time dawn has not arrived a blue brighter then the sky in daylight tears through the night sky with a big blue ring around it this clouded image emerges and the ring is vibrating as it enters I can feel the vibration hear it and see the ring shaking. The vibrating stops the shaking stops. It seems to be a vessel cloaked by clouds. a black clouded line has formed towards the ground as a bright orange/pink has formed going southwest directly off of the object. It had tail clouds at the end of the object and beams of mist going in multiple directions towards the east/NE. a flashing blinking white light appears from the figure and heads NE with an occasional flash of red. After out of sight another comes from the clouded huge figure and goes east if not southeast. These are the size of a pea. The huge formation itself takes up half of the size of the building complex but in the sky. I had asked if this was what I was meant to see as to why I had been locked outside and the balcony door suddenly opens after it is all over. I charge my phone and attached is all that was left in the sky as dawn surfaces. I had drawn immediately what I had seen in order to not forget although my drawing skills are not of expertise.

MUFON,12:00AM,3/15/21,,Hedgesville,WV ,WEST VIRGINIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I had begun my morning walk about 6:00A.M. at the Cape Cod Canal. I was heading east and happened to notice a fairly bright object moving horizontally from about the SW towards the NE in a straight line. It emitted no sound and no flashing lights. I'd estimate altitude at about 5000' or so since my viewing angle was about 60 degrees or so. Almost could distinguish some sort of exhaust but not clearly defined. Not anything like a pulse jet. It did not pass at a very high speed but fast enough for me to observe for only 30 seconds or so. I managed to get some video with my cell phone. I'm a Navy veteran that served on aircraft carriers as a jet mechanic. I also worked as a civilian employee for the Mass. Air National Guard for 24 years. I have been around aircraft my entire life and observed all types from fighters transports bombers and helicopters. This object did not appear to be any type of aircraft I have ever seen in my entire 74 years! I will be happy to send you my video. What stood out for me is that the craft was enveloped in a haze of sorts. Very strange! Content-type: text/html,,I saw 2 different UFOs. They are in sky every night for over a week now .

MUFON,2021-03-10 4:45AM,3/14/21,,montesano,WA ,WASHINGTON,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report While out having my morning coffee & cigarette and keeping eye to the sky I noticed a very long glowing or reflective light pattern moving across the night sky. It was at least 3x longer than any commercial airliner with no blinking lights. It had very distinct edges and ends (almost resembled a chain of bacteria). If there was any softness to the light it was on the top edge along the entire length giving it the appearance that it was flying at a slight tilt. The ends were squared with the top and bottom being parallel lines. This was not flying in outer space but in our atmosphere and moving just a little faster then I see airliners fly. It made no sound as it crossed my viewable skyline. Shortly after it was out of view I could hear a jet coming from the same direction as the object first appeared as I watched the jet it seemed to merge to the same trajectory as the object was last seen. I watch the night and morning sky’s everyday and have seen many things cross my view and have been able to identify 99.8% of what I see. I’ve even watched the Starlink satellites in their deployment but this one has me scratching my head. I have definitely imprinted this object in my brain as to not question or forget what I saw. This was just this morning 4:12am 03/14/2021 and I’ll have to sketch out what what I witnessed and submit it later.

MUFON,2021-03-14 4:12AM,3/14/21,,Cameron Park,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was headed home from work.. I turned east onto highway 30 and in the distance 12-35 miles out I observed 2 lights just above the deck...a red followed by a blue light. I continued to watch the object as I traveled across the Perrine Bridge and at this point the craft was in the SE just above the deck below the south hills. I turned west onto pole line road and thought to myself( well that's it its gone). I turned south onto Washington Street south I drive down to the CSI...and I saw a bright reflective like spinning diamond headed at me and a bit to the directly north. I immediately sped up to catch up to the object to intercross with it...I got up too filer road and took a left onto filer and then a quick right onto Jefferson Street. I pulled off to the right hand side and parked. I didn't want to pull my camera as not to have it dart away The object came up to just overhead of me and a bit to the East. IT STOPPED AND CHANGED INTO THE INVISIBLE CRAFT WITH A RED LIGHT ON ONE END AND A BLUE DIMMER LIGHT ON THE OTHER.. it was 1000-1500 ft. overhead. I could not ever stare into the bright light it was too bright! I watched the object for 20 seconds...then it turned back into the bright diamond light object and started heading south...first slowly then faster ..just gliding away. I headed the same way in my car and continued to observe it as I drove down Washington street south..it went THRU the steam at lamb Weston and sped off..at this point it could of been 300 above the deck. I traveled down Washington street south until I almost got to the Shell station across from Swenson's Market on the SW corner..it was headed back towards me by then from the south..as a bright light spinning diamond it appeared out of nowhere. As I observed in awe I wanted to alert a car of kids parked next to me but was afraid too. I watched the object straight up! About 200 feet up and the bright light changed back to the invisible cigar craft about 50 ft. long then. with a bright red light followed by a blue dimmer light that looked like it was enclosed in a clear outer as the blue light was a bit dimmer and cloudy. When the object got directly overhead I heard a fan like sound. I got in.my car ..got to the red light headed east...a CALMNESS CAME OVER THE WHOLE AREA AND IT SEEMED TO TAKE FOREVER FOR THE LIGHT TO CHANGE TO GREEN..WHAT AN ERIE FEELING. When the light turned green and I turned left (back south) The craft was GONE ..I assumed it would be headed back north in front of me?? Where did it go?? Why am I chosen to see these things?

MUFON,2021-03-14 5:50AM,3/14/21,,Winter springs,FL ,FLORIDA,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report I witnessed an object moving directly over my residence whilst I was standing outside. It was boomerang shaped with an outline that was difficult to see but was visible as it was moving and at no time was stationary. The object was very large that I estimate was at least 1/4 mile across it's wingspan. It displayed perfect camouflage and I could only observe it's outline against the night sky. It was bending light around itself and had a ""mirror"" effect. There was absolutely no sound. Conditions are calm and clear tonight. I do not take drugs or drink alcohol. I do not take any perscription medicines. All information I have disclosed is true and correct to the best of my ability and of my own free will without any expectation of financial gain or elevated status.

MUFON,2021-03-04 2:01AM,3/14/21,,Manteca,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report I was outside around 9 pm taking night-pictures of my house with my iPhone. I recently installed a ""smart"" flood-lamp and was experimenting with the variety of color options the bulb is capable of emitting. While taking photos someone began shooting off fireworks approximately two miles north of my house. I attempted to capture a video of the fireworks but they stopped as abruptly as they began. I then decided to take photos of nearby homes south of my house because I admired the architecture. As I aimed my iPhone camera toward the house and took the photo I thought I saw a light appear in the sky from the corner of my eye. However when I looked in the direction of the object I did not see anything. Shortly after the fireworks began again behind me. I turned around to capture a video of the fireworks which lasted for just over ten seconds. Then they stopped again. I decided to call it a night and go back into the house. As I reviewed the photos I realized I captured a triangle-shaped object in the photo of the nearby home. I cannot discern if it is a single triangle-shaped object or three-triangle-shaped objects in tight formation. I am a former US Air Force Avionics Technician (B-52 and KC-135) and a commercial airline Avionics Technician (Boeing 7XX series). I do not recognize the object(s) in the photo. It could be an anomaly or some type of reflection. However the shape is very distinctive. It definitely is not a firework as they were only observed several miles in the opposite direction of this object north versus south respectively. I am completely open to plausible explanations of the object in the photo.

MUFON,2020-10-24 9:12AM,3/14/21,,Twin Falls,ID ,IDAHO,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I am 70 years old and this sighting was sometime in the 60's. i was 15 or 16 so 1965 or 1966. It was summer and I was outside laying in the grass looking at stars and looking for satellites I had done this many times so I knew how slowly they move. Suddenly an object came from the eastern horizon and flew directly over me flew to the west in a matter of 3 seconds. There was no sound. At that time we lived on a farm in NE Montana in the flight path of military planes from Minot AFB ND to Glasgow AFB and Malmstrom AFB so I was very familiar with these planes. The size of the light was about the Venus so a large star. I have tried to figure out how low a plane would have to flying to get from one horizon the next in 3 seconds. It seemed to be flying at a height of a normal airliner but it was so fast it could have been lower. If anyone can help me with this calculation I would really like that. At the time I knew it was a UFO because nothing flies that fast.

These suckers were pretty hard to see because they didn't really produce much if any light. It looked as if we were looking at a cluster of distant dim stars.... but these were moving together and pretty fast against the stiff wind. The evening was pretty bright overall. We were sitting at my Mom's grave site with a few lights around so we could see what we were eating (can explain that later). I saw my 17 yr. old daughter's jaw (literally) drop as she looked up. She couldn't speak at first. I looked up to see what she was looking at. It took me a second to realize what I was seeing. Once I sprung up from my chair and shouted my daughter said ""OMG! What is it""? My 15 yr. old daughter also was able to see it. My wife couldn't find it as it almost seemed semi transparent OR it was reflecting ambient light from below. Tough to see but unmistakably a craft (NOT birds)! In fact after we saw the first one we discussed the flock of migrating birds theory. The second craft was much bigger and twice as fast. My wife saw that one! The third one seemed to be brighter. It straightened out into an unorganized line then split off in awkward and unorganized way .... turned up and to the left. but no longer in a boomerang shape NO noise from any.

MUFON,1965-08-15 10:00PM,3/13/21,,Lambert,MT ,MONTANA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report BACKGROUND: Since I first saw a large red orb in August of 2020 (MUFON report 110659) I have documented on video hundreds of orbs of varying sizes colors and distances appearing over Central New York. These orbs are an every night event if the sky is clear these strange orbs are visible. I have purchased two nightvision cameras in order to document and attempt to explain what I am seeing but the events I capture are getting stranger over time. On Tuesday March 9th 2021 I went outside during my usual nightly filming session at 645 and set up one camera in a fixed location on a tripod and another on a monopod that I could use to control. I was on an elevated pool deck where I saw the typical orbs I see on a nightly basis and recorded those. Throughout the night I observed multiple orbs moving through the airspace at speeds that I've never seen some were captured some were not. Around 750PM I saw a rather bright orb through my second camera and was tracking the object as it flew over my neighborhood. I used a green laser pointer to circle the object and upon doing this it seemed as though I provoked a response. The object began to move much more rapidly and also dimmed as it was very bright before. I eventually lost the object over the southern sky. I looked up and there were 2 very bright orbs directly over me. One orb seemed to circle and another orb slowly moved passed me until moving over the nearby treeline where I lost sight. I noticed a lot of movement in the sky above me but was unable to see anything else with my eyes. Unfortunately the video recording from the camera I was using is somehow corrupted despite all other files being intact. My other camera managed to record audio and video from the incident but was pointing slightly off from where I was. Upon playback of the videos recorded from my secondary camera I realized how many objects had been above me that night. I have 100s of videos of these strange orbs flying over a densely populated city. I use star charts air traffic radar satellite tracking etc to debunk and I still cannot figure out what I am witnessing. I have uploaded a few videos to youtube in hopes of finding answers but I am not sure where to go now. Content-type: text/html,,Fast Flying UFO,line,,"Lambert,MT "

It looked like it was flying very low and was completely silent. It had hundreds of lights around the perimeter that seemed to rotate. It looked to be about the size of a football stadium. It was enormous. We observed it for about 3 or 4 minutes floating above the tree line at a consistent speed. It was extremely slow moving. It never changed direction and it made absolutely no sound at all. It’s hard to describe how massive and slow it was.

MUFON,2021-03-12 11:06PM,3/12/21,,Weedsport,NY ,NEW YORK,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Around 6:50pm : ball of bright light flying what appeared to be downward before disappearing completely right before it looked as if it was going to hit the ground. Wasn’t too far away from us and we didn’t hear any sound of crashing or engine noise. Everything seemed to be silent during and after sighting. We were driving through backroads surrendered by flat corn field land and didn’t see any type of crash. The orb seemed to disappear in thin air. It was a very bright light and seemed to be artificial light and led like. I would say the size of a basketball (maybe a tiny bit bigger). Hard to estimate though because of the speed it was flying at. We almost thought it was a shooting star falling from the sky (because we could see stars that night) but it was much bigger and much brighter. The light was not blinking and was moving in a straight line. It didn’t seem to have any glow to it and it didn’t leave any type of trail of light. It was a solid ball of white light. We didn’t notice it until it came in view from the front windshield. We didn’t notice anything from the rear view or the side windows. This was not a cloudy night as the moon and all stars were visible. It was moving very fast... the actual sighting only happened in about a 3 second time frame. And the technological difficulties for about another 1 - 1 & 1/2 minutes. Although It did feel longer (more like a 10 minute time pass). Right before the sighting the bluetooth in my car cut out and my phone disconnected. It took a couple miles before we were able to reconnect and get the music to play again. That’s never happened before. We take these back roads to Dixon a lot and have never dealt with the bluetooth not working. Our phones also began to not work. We both had no signal for a couple miles before it kicked back in. My friend (the other witnesses) was unable to even unlock her phone. It seemed to have just froze. I was able to unlock my phone but had trouble using voice text. It was severely misunderstanding what I was saying. I called my sister after the sighting and she said whenever I was about to explain something the sound would cut off but she could hear me fine with everything else I said. Only when I started to explain what we had saw. I did not feel sick before during or after the sighting and neither did my friend who was in the car with me. We both did not feel dizzy or any type of tingling. My friend an alien skeptic has no explanation for what we saw. Me a huge alien believer knows what we saw. It appeared to have technological advances that just are not known to us. It was a “man made” light flying at unbelievable speeds before disappearing right in front of our eyes. And the unexpected technological difficulties made the sighting even more real to us.

I was walking my dog at home at 2222 hrs. on February 22 (2/22). Crystal clear night star gazing as we walked. I looked up in a Crystal clear sky at Orion when I noticed what appeared to be a satellite slowly tracking across the sky and the constellation in a straight line path. I stopped to observe.

MUFON,2021-03-12 5:24AM,3/12/21,,Saint Paul,MN ,MINNESOTA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report On January 1 2019 at approximately 10:10 p.m. I was on the 101 Freeway heading north having just left Cottage Hospital where I had been visiting my father. As I passed the Fairview exit and was approaching the Los Carneros exit I saw a strange circular craft-like object hovering above the tree line on the southbound side of the freeway. I was so amazed at what I was looking at that I braked to slow down and rolled down my window in order to possibly hear any noise that might be emanating from it. There was no sound that I could detect. However the object or craft morphed from a dark outline and nearly invisible to a pastel-colored craft in full view. It slightly wobbled in a wave-like pattern (like a mirage). At that point I would estimate the size of the craft to have been approximately two car lengths in width -- maybe more and perhaps 10 or more feet in height -- no windows or doors. During the days that followed I performed internet searches of UFO sightings in the Santa Barbara area but didn't come across anything. To this day I am left wondering what this object was. Could it have been a hologram? Someone's expensive (toy) drone (after all Christmas was only one week prior)? As a side note at that particular time of night (New Year's Day) there was hardly any traffic on the freeway.

I always look for the Big Dipper which shows which way north is. I observed a light which was between the two tops (of the scoop) but further out making the Big Dipper look like a pentagon. After about 30 seconds I observed another light turn on near this light. Immediately the 1st light started moving fast towards the north east while the second light followed close behind. While the objects started fading away I observed a light beam come from the first object directed at the second. After the beam both objects disappeared from my line of sight. I served 7 years in the Army (Active) and 6 years as a PO and have never seen anything like it. Earlier in the evening around 7 I observed a satellite which I often see. These two lights were not that 100%. I tried taking my phone out but you could not see anything due to the distance and faintness of light. I also observed an airplane at cruising altitude fly over me around this time and the two objects were way above that.

MUFON,12:00AM,3/10/21,,Nelsonville,OH ,OHIO,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report My husband I and our 4 year old son went on a camping trip to New Mexico in October 1995. During the trip my husband pulled into a remote camping spot (remote but it had a concrete slab outdoor grill overhang shelter trashcan. We parked our truck there (truck had a camper shell we could sleep in.). We made made a fire in the grill our son played around (never leaving the spot we parked in) husband was startled while sitting by the fire by a huge animal ( or elk) that walked up very close then we turned in to sleep in the bed of the truck inside camper shell We fell asleep. Then at 1am I awoke. I know the time because I was wearing an Indiglo watch and looked at it when I awoke. I looked out the slats of a small window in the camper my son right next to me husband on the other side of him both sound asleep. Through the slats I saw a bright white light through the trees kind of in the distance but close enough to see three silhouettes. The light and figures came closer so I woke my husband and asked him to look also. He saw them but said ‘Oh it’s just ’. I pointed out that don’t carry lights and they were standing on two legs! He agreed. As we stared they kept getting closer. This is where it got frightening. At one point we could see them outlined very clearly. They stopped advancing toward us. I had shined a flashlight out at them to get s better look. Here is a description (this sight is burned in my memory and very clear!). There were three of them. Not sure how tall because trees were the only reference point. Not unusually tall or short. -shaped heads. The heads were not shaped like human heads. Arms were very long; the hands hung down by their knees and hands had three fingers each. The faces were indistinguishable so no detail. The striking features were the head shape long thin arms and three fingers. The light began to swing back and forth and they started walking toward our truck again. The light swung like a lantern I thought. But it got much brighter white then turned orange. It flashed white orange white orange and then they were VERY close. The light was super bright. I remember being so frightened and suddenly got very sleepy. I remember thinking ‘I’m so terrified but at least I’m falling asleep and won’t have to feel it anymore’. It was blissful like when you are about to go into surgery and the anesthesia hits suddenly. The next thing I remember was waking up in our truck camper at 11am. (Again I looked at my watch). As we rolled out of our camper to begin cleaning up our campsite to leave none of us recalled the weird night sighting before. Then two men rode up on horseback. I noticed right away they looked out of place. Having grown up in the rodeo and helping my dad ‘break’ wild horses and riding them for years I knew the gear the clothing the mannerisms etc. of riders. These two men were wearing what looked like felt vests brand new  the horses gear looked new and the men sat very straight up in the saddles. They looked like actors portraying guys on horseback. I smiled and in a typical friendly texas way said hi! They looked at me sternly and one of them said ‘ not many people come up here in this remote area. How was your evening?’ My husband answered it was fine the sky was beautiful at night we’re just packing to out of here. They never smiled acted very official and just said ‘good’. I thought the exchsnge was weird as country guys on horseback are always helpful and friendly. They left. We packed up drove down to a town called Mountainair and our truck suddenly died. Just as we hit town. Hubby walked over to a junkyard close by to use the phone (pre-cellphone era!). The guy there said oh youre in luck I’m also the . He looked at our vehicle said it would take maybe three days to get the part he needed and pointed us to a little motel we could stay at. After truck was fixed days later we headed out. It wasn’t until about ten years later I was sitting at a computer and suddenly the memory of the whole incident came back to me. We literally had no recollection all those years of what we had seen. I thought: hmmm that’s weird. I searched ‘Manzano Mountains aliens’ but we had never talked about seeing them or even remembered seeing them. This was my first encounter (during the search) with the word ‘Grays’. As I searched more I saw pictures of supposed ‘alien’ beings and was stunned to remember and realize those three figures looked just like what I was seeing in articles. I learned there was an underground base in the Manzano mountains (Red Canyon is in those mountains). I eventually read about ‘men in black’ who visit people the day after an encounter usually in twos. I wondered if that explained the two unfriendly guys on horseback who appeared the next morning and who did not seem dressed like real riders and whose demeanor was unusual also. My husband preferred to forget the whole incident but Once it came back in my memory I could not. This is the first time I’ve reported it other than to friends who would listen (but who likely didn’t believe or want to believe such a crazy story. Our son had no recollection of it. He slept the whole time. He did have a few strange occurences a few years later. He said he felt like someone was outside his window sometimes watching him. He also said he woke up upside down in bed sometimes and thought it was weird (his feet on the pillow where his head and been when he went sleep and his head at the foot of the bed. None of that seemed important though until I read years later about others having those things happen after an encounter. Hubby has (infrequently though) thrashed around in his sleep and screamed out (like terrified!) ‘help somebody help me!’) I just wonder in the back of my mind if we didn’t encounter real alien beings out there. No recollection at all of anything that happened after they approached our truck the blissful feeling of going to sleep suddenly and waking the next morning.

At first I thought it was the line of other flights to land after us but after watching them for a few minutes I noticed our elevation changed but their did not. I decided to focus a bit more on them to see if they were blinking as beacon lights would on planes but nothing. The lights stayed at the same elevation during my entire landing and I captured 3 of them with my iPhone just before we landed. You can’t tell in the video but we are already below the mountain peaks so this can’t be a landing line for planes. Others on the flight were talking about them but we don’t know what they were. I know at night our cameras create an “orb” effect than many mistake for UFO’s but that is not the case here. Take a look at the video I’m sure many others saw these hovering.

We saw some of them simply vanish some would glow in a large orb then with the same brightness shrink in orb size. We were unable to get any closer as they were above a wild area above the tree line but lower than an airplane. We were so stunned we didn’t think to take a picture or video. They were still there when we left going to the northeast. We didn’t report it because we didn’t think anyone would believe us... just discovered MUFON.

MUFON,2019-04-08 8:20PM,3/8/21,,Phoenix,AZ ,ARIZONA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I live on the Fox River at 1901 N River Rd. At about 1:00 pm I turned right out of my driveway to drive to Jewel Food store on east Algonquin Rd Algonquin IL. As soon as I turned north out of my driveway I immediately noticed a bright object shining sunlight reflecting off it) above the road. I immediately realized it must be a UFO because I have never seen anything like it. The object was heading from left to right and as I drove I was trying to keep my eye on it and was trying to grab my phone to take a photo. There are tall trees along the right side of River Rd and the object I was able to view because there are no leaves on the trees at this time. I sped up to get to a spot 300 ft north of my driveway where there is an open area where the road goes up a hill to 4/5 houses to the right. I was planning to stop and take a photo. All the time I was viewing the object thru my windshield. Once I reached the open area the object was passing over the hill. I sped up to go to Haegers Bend Rd about a third of a mile north on River Rd. I turned right on Haegers Bend Rd and sped down the road but lost sight of it. THe object consisted of two cylindrical objects linked together. Each object was looked about 40 to 50 ft long and hooked together by a mechanical link. The height of the cylinders was about 12 ft . the cylinders followed each other in a straight line. They were very bright because the sun was reflecting off them against a clear blue sky. The object was very visible and clear to view. It was the first time I have witnessed what I suspect a UFO in bright daylite conditions. It came from a westerly direction and should have been noticed by others because it was relatively low about the height a hellicopter would fly 800 to 1000 ft AGL. I have hellicopter flight time but not a licenced pilot. It was agreat experience that only lasted about 15 to 20 seconds.

MUFON,2021-03-03 8:45AM,3/8/21,,Kennett Square,PA ,PENNSYLVANIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report While Outdoors adjusting my digital Television antenna I noticed a few commercial aircraft with corresponding vapor trails when from the south a Smaller MUCH faster object appeared at a 60 Degree angle from my field of view. it was moving at Very high speed to the north. in the same field of view was a commercial airliner flying East to west towards Tulsa Oklahoma. Before the Aircraft & unknown object were to cross paths. the smaller faster object come to a dead stop in the sky for approximately 30 seconds there was no radial curve apparent in the objects flight path but from it's hovering position in the sky it headed due east at roughly twice the speed it had been moving previously. we normally have Civilian and Military Aircraft pass over daily and they are usually quite easily identified as such. this object had no apparent wings or rotors and moved silently in comparison to other known aircraft.

MUFON,2021-03-05 1:00PM,3/6/21,,Algonquin Il,IL ,ILLINOIS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I worked at the mall in Fort Smith AR in 2006 and got off late after 10pm. I turned onto Waldron going towards Rogers Ave. I was on the phone with my boyfriend and I noticed some lights in the sky East of me. My first thought was fireworks but quickly dismissed that. They didn't look like any I'd ever seen and it was not near any holiday. They were flashing lights multicolored. I turned east onto Rogers and soon realized the lights were part of an aircraft. It was very slow-moving and very low to the ground maybe 1000 feet. It seemed barely higher than the tallest building an 8-story bank. My next thought was a blimp. I rolled my window all the way down and strained to hear anything. There was virtually no traffic. I could not hear anything coming from this craft. Eventually it began to cross Rogers Ave and I drove directly underneath it. It was impossibly huge and I just couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was several football fields wide and triangular shaped. It was a solid craft as it blocked out the stars above it. I had my head out of my window slowed down to a crawl and could still hear nothing! It was moving so slowly I was able to keep up with it going well below the speed limit. It eventually crossed over Rogers and headed toward the direction of Fort Chaffee a military base. I don't have much of a memory of what happened after seeing it. One of my coworkers saw it from a different part of town that night. I don't know if it was reported to the authorities by anyone. I still don't know what I saw. I know it wasn't a blimp or airplane. It was a solid craft not several in a formation. I don't remember seeing lights underneath it but possibly because I was focused on trying to see the outline. I've never seen anything that comes close to the size. Content-type: text/html,,BRIGHT CONNECTED OBJECTS IN SKY,line,,"Algonquin Il,IL "
MUFON,2021-03-06 12:30PM,3/6/21,,Gentry,AR ,ARKANSAS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I saw two white spheres very small very high. Would have been northeast of Aurora in my estimation. They moved independently. Not erratically but they exhibited noticeable linear movement independent of each other and at different speeds. Seemed too high to be any bird or balloon. Also the difference in speed and direction made it seem like they weren't blowing in the wind. I stood and watched them for a few minutes wondering what they were. After moving a bit more they disappeared. They didn't fade away or move away that I could see. They were just gone. Curious if anyone else saw these.

MUFON,2020-11-07 2:00PM,3/5/21,,Pleasant Gap,PA ,PENNSYLVANIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report We moved from Alabama to Arkansas in Fall of 2019. I had to return to Alabama for my doctors visit each month. December was just another month; I was on the way back from my doc in Bama and while traveling on Craighead 47 Rd I noticed two cars pulled over on the right side of the road and so I slowed down I figured it was an accident. However I noticed three people standing outside their car looking upward. While passing them I looked up to see what they were looking at. It was a large black triangle well above power lines and not too far above the pine tree line cross over the road but when it was close to the center of the soybean field it stopped and hovered. After a couple of minutes it started moving back toward the west. It had lights underneath the vehicle and they were all lit up. If I would have had my slingshot I could have hit it. I slowly drove on watching it the whole way. I was not going to offer myself up for any encounter and so after it was safely in my rear view I took off home. I have only shared this event with my wife and my sons. When I was around ten while traveling back from a Church event (father is retired pastor) late one evening along the Lake Michigan coast my mother and father noticed a glowing orb remarkably high in the sky flying like no man-made vehicle can maneuver. We could see it in the distance or a long time. My father tried to drive in its direction but we could not keep up and eventually it was nowhere to be seen. We were all in awe. Anyway I shared this first experience to say this ... people would mock you to your face in the 1970's if you admitted to seeing a UFO. So I haven't shared my latest experience with anyone but my closest family memebers. Content-type: text/html,,Round silver shiny no wings wires lights sound or markings.,line,,"Pleasant Gap,PA "
MUFON,2021-03-05 8:02PM,3/5/21,,North Port FL,FL ,FLORIDA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report While inside my home I noted a object approximately 15 miles SE of the TAPPA gps intersection at an estimated 35 000' that appeared suddenly and traveling South. The object appeared pointed at the front and wider at the rear like a pyramid that had been stretched out. Almost as soon as I noticed the first object a second identical object appeared flying in formation with the first craft. Moments later two other craft appeared behind the first two. One craft was flying vertically and the second was flying straight down at an incredible rate. All the craft had appeared almost instantaneously. The craft all reflected sunlight while observable. None of the craft left a contrail. I was inside and did not note any sound. Almost as soon as the craft had all appeared they all disappeared in an instant. They appeared to fall out of sight from there current positions. The entire time from the appearance of the first craft until they all disappeared I would estimate to only be 7 seconds. I continued to watch the sky in the same direction hoping to see the craft reappear. The craft did not reappear however within two minutes I noted an airliner traveling northbound at approximately the same altitude. The airliner was visible and reflecting sunlight the whole time it was in the observable sky. The airliner also left a very visible contrail which lends credence to the fact that the atmospheric conditions at that time and altitude should have produced a contrail for any turbine propulsion system.

The White dot I watch for 3 minutes it started to pulse blue flashing lights pulsing almost spinning like. Almost as if it acknowledging we saw it. It was blue skylines so strange that we were seeing lights in the day. 30 minutes later a white light appears closer to us in the clouds. It follows the clouds away for about 4 minutes which we have on video. This was 15 000 I would say. Although there was no blue light on this abject.

MUFON,2021-03-14 4:12AM,3/14/21,,Cameron Park,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Observed bright orangish yellow single light much brighter than a star or airplane light. Slowly disappeared as it proceeded north. It was not unlike seeing the space station except this was much brighter and following it were three more every 2-4 minutes. All of them similar in brightness. None of them were visible at the same time in the sky. Being that it was 6:30ish the sun was down enough that it could very well reflect off a space object and reflect the sunlight on us. We assumed it was Starlink but did research on location of Starlink and found that it was nowhere near us as far as we could tell. We recorded on video the last 3 lights with our phones and have the time stamp recorded on video. No doubt it was probably a cluster of satellites but can't find them anywhere when searching online.

MUFON,2021-03-11 4:53AM,3/11/21,,KENNEWICK,WA ,WASHINGTON,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report A friend and I were taking a night hike in the foothills (Hulls Gulch Trail) Behind Camelsback Park. Not long after all the stars became visible in the night sky a bright light in the sky caught our attention. Something stationary lit up ( to a substantial magnitude ). We both reacted at the same time to the phenomenon. Out of the dark sky we noticed a bright light that wasnt there previously. It slowly reduced magnituded and vanished for a few seconds. It then slowly reappeared gaining an intensity from zero to a peak of -6 Approximate Astronomical Magnitude within the period of about 4 seconds. Brightness was slightly brighter then venus on a close transit on a clear cool night. I have astronomical knowledge and am aware of iridium flashes the ISS and other atmospheric/astronomical objects and phenomena. Including Starlink rocket launches defunct satellite reentry fireball meteors and satellites.. I've seen much of what there is to see in the night sky. We immediately checked Iss Tracker to insure that we didn't mistaken if for the ISS. (Even though this object was stationary over the period of about 10-15 seconds). It was very unusual and for someone that spends a lot of time outside at night I can safely say this was beyond my scope of awareness. After disappearing absolutely no object was seen leaving the scene. No planes helicopters or drones. This was extremely high altitude or in space. A new one for me. So I will do my diligent duty and report it.

MUFON,2021-02-28 6:28PM,3/1/21,,Walla Walla,WA ,WASHINGTON,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report On the night of Dec 5 2020 I was out taking astrophotography photos of the Orion constellation. No observable event took place during my session. However once home the uploaded images revealed the structure in one of the photos I captured. What makes this sighting mysterious is the solid definitive symmetry and the accelerated disappearance of the object in the following image which took place. The 3 images were all taken with minutes and the objected appeared in the middle photo and was gone one minute later in the following photo. I am not a scientist but the object compared to the whole sky was huge and disappeared within one minute begging the question how an object of that size was gone a minute later from the entire sky view. At 21:57 media file 1 (5729) shows the clear sky no object then at 21:58 CDT media file 2 (5831) shows a clear structure has appeared within one minute of previous photo. Media file 3 (5047) shows another clear picture of the object. Then media file 4 (5918) shows the clear sky again with object seemingly disappeared. This very well could be a case of mistaken identity with object being the Musk Starlink Satellite Array that has been deployed however I could find no objects of Starlink that appeared with such perfect symmetry or appearance in my research I completed online.

I've seen video of the Starlink sightings but these lights did NOT move in a straight line. It was almost like they were on a string for a little while.....then they flew off and more of the same orbs came from the same direction.....and over and over again. They followed basically the same route but absolutely not in a straight line. I'm not someone who sees UFOs around every corner. I DID observe one when I was around 10 from the backseat of my parents' car. But this experience last night was unlike that or anything else I've seen video of.

MUFON,2020-12-20 9:57PM,1/17/21,,Crossville,TN ,TENNESSEE,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report My daughter and I were driving on Hwy 245 when we saw 6-7 bright red lights that looked like small low flying aircraft at first glance. This is a very remote dark area. The lights moved in a straight line in front of the car with an occasional flash of white in the red. They moved about the same speed as airplanes and that’s what we first thought they were - except they weren’t. The last two lights tended to go off to the sides then get back in formation. We stopped abruptly to take video and noticed they were completely silent. We got two more video clips a few yards down the road. We drove down to the intersection of Hwy 245 and Hwy 7. By this time they’d shifted more north and changed elevation. We watched them disappear over the mountain and couldn’t see then again. We’ve seen Starlink before but that wasn’t this.

At first I thought it was a reflection on the window from Christmas lights until I realized they were moving. I thought they may be helicopters however there was no sound at all. I observed them until they disappeared over the NE horizon. They did change formation from a straight line into a grouped pattern. Some lights would disappear and then others appeared. I managed to get a video the lights were much redder than the video shows. The very last light was larger and brighter and also flashed white along with red but it did not appear to be a plane or other aircraft. I took a photo of my star map during the incident to confirm it was not starlink. I’ve witnessed several star link chains and this did not resemble them at all.

MUFON,2020-12-05 5:02PM,12/6/20,,Baker City,OR ,OREGON,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report On 12/03/20 at 1858 hours I was Working in Boulder County and at Walden Ponds. I noticed three bright lights in a diagonal pattern perfectly spaced. I first thought it was Orion’s belt. But then more lights appeared spaced evenly from a brighter center light. There was approximately 15 to 20 lights which were evenly spaced in a diagonal orientation. These lights were easily within the atmosphere and did not appear to be moving. The lights would pulsate in a fashion of going almost completely dim and then Becoming brighter. I was able to get my cell phone out and took video of the incident. The video is difficult to see in a poor quality. I then proceeded to take to steal photos of the lights to try and get Better evidence. The event lasted approximately three minutes from the time I started to see the lights until they completely disappeared. It should be noted that two other deputies also saw the lights. It should also be noted that at approximately 1930 hrs. we received a call from DIA informing us of a jet at 35 000 feet that was blinded by a laser. The location given by the pilot was not in the location of these lights and I do not believe a laser could produce the lightsWhich I had seen. I understand there is a new satellite system flying in the air called Starlink. I would like to note that these lights were well within the atmosphere and we’re not moving in a fashion as to satellites which I have seen in the past. I also checked the star link website which shows when star link would be visible in the Denver metro area. Per the website it was at approximately 1830 hrs.. I again want to reiterate the fact that I do not believe these were the Starlink satellites. I sent dispatch a photo of the lights which they were going to send either to DIA or the FAA.

I thought at first they were planes or stars but as I paid closer attention I counted a total of 7 lights that were in a straight line from left to right equal distance from each other with about a 30 or 45 degree angle of incline from left to right. I observed the lights change intensity of brightness from low to high back to low and repeat slowly and intermittently. They appeared to remain motionless and static but I did observe 2 different lights creep out of line slightly then return to position within the line. That was the only deviation or movement I saw. Then when I went to record the sighting they all disappeared. Couldn't get any footage.

MUFON,2020-12-05 5:35PM,12/5/20,,Tampa,FL ,FLORIDA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report At about 5:15 AM this morning I walked out of my house and looked up at the stars as I always do and noticed what looked to be a bright meteor streak. But I noticed it did not fade as they usually do and it was moving. I saw it directly over head and traveling very slowly toward the southeast. I would estimate a land speed of about 15-20 mph. It was a continuous narrow string of lights. Each next to the other. It was very long and occupied about 10 degrees of the sky as observed from the ground. It was low. about the altitude of an airplane. It made absolutely no sound. We live in a very quiet place next to the Cleveland National Forest. You can hear a leaf drop especially early in the morning but this made no sound. Even a blimp would make some noise. Since it was dark I could not see any other shape other than the string of lights I saw it from overhead going form a northeast to a southeast direction. My observation lasted about a minute and a half to two minutes. It finally traveled out of sight behind the mountains and below my horizon. This was nothing like the starlink lights which I see often and which are very high and about 2 - 3 degrees apart as observed from the earth. It was also not a meteor which as an armature astronomer I see often. This was clearly an object traveling slowly and silently across the sky until it moved out of sight behind the San Vicente mountain to the southeast.

MUFON,2020-12-03 6:58PM,12/5/20,,Boulder,CO ,COLORADO,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report The initial object spotted was flying at an unknown altitude. It made no noise. It could not be seen with the naked eye. It was spotted using night vision devices. It appeared to be between the size of a fighter aircraft and a 737. As the object flew over the actual shape was hard to make out. The light pattern reminded me of low visibility ""formation"" lighting used by military aircraft. What made this very distinct was the lack of noise and the fact that it appeared the object was purposefully dialing through a series of patterns created by the formation lights. The first light pattern was a boomerang shape and then it shifted to a triangle shape and just before it went out of view it had shifted to a circular shape. The only thing that appeared to change was the light pattern NOT the actual shape. After this object passed by at a fairly decent speed a second object followed in trail and resembled the first object. This one was emitting the circular pattern of lights and as it passed overhead it was almost as if it knew we could see it and it headed to put itself between us and the moon so that the moonglow would hide the object from our NVG's. At that point we could not find it with night vision nor normal vision. The assumption was the object killed all of its external lighting once in the moonglow relative to our position as we never saw it after that despite watching for the next two hours. We were able to observe multiple satellites aircraft and even the starlink train as it passed to the north but these were definitely not like any of the standard objects.

I noticed a row of lights approximately 20-25 degrees above the horizon (presumably it being dark at the time of sighting) just to the right of straight ahead of my direction of travel. My first thought was the Starlink satellites though I noticed no motion in the lights and they appeared to be wrapped around the edges of what would have been a circular something. The lights appeared evenly-spaced along a slightly tilted horizontal axis. Observation lasted only 30seconds to 1min. We attempted to keep it in sight but found that impossible on a relatively busy highway. The last I saw of whatever this was it appeared that it may have been obscured by a cloud. Weather conditions were mostly clear with some scattered clouds; half moon present to our left (roughly south) during the observation. My daughter managed to take several photos with her iPhone 8 which surprised me a bit given oncoming headlights taillights of the cars ahead of us etc. The images are blurry (taken through the car's dirty windshield) but the object is obvious in them. Given the local terrain I imported the images into ""Photos"" on my iMac and looked at the GPS stamps on them for the possible presence of skiing mountains or other topography in the area. I wondered if a lit access road or mountaintop could be an explanation but other than Mt. Sunapee in the area (no night skiing or other mountaintop lights that I'm aware of) there was nothing obvious. Using Google maps street view of the area of the sighting in the direction it occurred also left me with no obvious possibilities.

At approximately 6:25 am I looked at the handle of the big dipper and observed multiple objects that were flying from the southeast on the same plane as were Mars was low on the western horizon. I pointed them out to my wife and we observed the objects traveling out of sight along a rough line. They were in small groups of 2 or 3 but not in formation. They had no navigational markers like a normal aircraft has. The objects appeared to be reflecting sunlight off of them. Each object had about the same brightness as the stars in the big dipper. About 2 minutes into their movement two objects came up from the horizon looking slightly northwest from our position and joined into the group. It was still out and no wind was blowing either. We never heard any sound emanate from them of any kind. About 5 minutes after they had left we watched a couple of commercial jets head south from PDX which is about 50 miles to our Northeast. They were in the normal flight path with regular marker lights on the wing tips and we could hear them. We tried to video them but couldnt collect enough light with my wifes I phone to make one. And no they were not the starlink satellites. They will not be visible in our area before tomorrow night and we would have to look south to see them.

MUFON,2020-10-13 10:03AM,10/13/20,,Emeryville,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report UFO sightings Gulf Shores From 5SEPT2020 to 12SEPT2020 I was staying at a shorefront beach house with my family at Gulf Shores Alabama (dodged the hurricane my god...) At night I'd always go out and skywatch using my PVS-7 NVGs. Unfortunately it wasn't until after I saw these occurrences that I thought to hold my phone camera to an eye piece on the NVGs but days following these sightings I wasn't fortunate enough to witness anything else. Keep in mind when viewing space using NVGs most everything is a star-like dot. All sightings aside from a meteor were only viewable using NVGs I could not see any of the lights with my naked eyes. 5SEPT2020 The first was moving like a satellite and then stopped completely in one position for a few seconds and then started another direction and stopped again for a few more seconds it repeated this a few times and then disappeared behind the cloud layer. The second was a giant V formation (like a flock of glowing geese in space) going along extremely fast North to South and had to be at least 30 dots all in one line with slight deviance in formation as it moved while still retaining a strong ""V"" shape. Very similar to the Lubbock Lights but bigger and 1 not 2 rows. I watched this from about 120 degrees North all the way til it disappeared about 20 degrees South. Seeing that one made me “WTF” out loud. The 3rd was a pair of lights very close to each other like a couple of planes would fly in formation moving in a very slight arc Southeast to East. They too were extremely fast and above the cloud layer there was no sound heard. September 6 Single light no movement flashing and had a steady pace consistently figured it was a satellite spinning. Single light heading south to north sharp slight changes in direction as if drunkenly following a line. September 7 9o’clock p.m. Further out and up over the Gulf a small formation of maybe 10 dots moving East to West super high up and in a line formation. not as fast moving as the ""V"" formation I previously had seen (not column like the Starlink satellites) I had my wife and an Army buddy with me at that time and made sure to pass the NVGs to them as quick as I could so there'd be more witnesses to it. They both confirmed what I was seeing. Saw a massive meteor breaking apart into pieces for a good 3 seconds. I was really surprised at all the large pieces breaking off it was some real apocalyptical looking stuff. September 8 7:50pm saw lots of satellites and one dot moving slightly faster in a line and then did an “S” move then Continued straight. similar to the one I saw on Sept 6th but its ""S"" move seemed more deliberate instead of a shaky movement.

After about 20 seconds of observing them travel southeast the second light of the chain quickly changed color to white and stopped. We heard a sound that came from it that sounded like a firework exploding in the distance. The white light proceeded to fall out of the sky. The rest of the lights behind it reacted by moving in a zig-zag pattern before changing from traveling in a strait line to traveling into more of a triangular shape and quickly sped off in the same south east direction into the night sky.

I was outside looking at the clear winter night sky all the stars. Suddenly I noticed a bright pinpoint of light moving across the sky like a star that decided to move only brighter. They had no flashing lights like our aircraft. Their flight path was unusual because air traffic in this area is always north-south and these were moving southwest to northeast and quickly. They appeared in the sky near Orion (from my point of view) and vanished once they were across the sky between the handle of the Big Dipper and the horizon. As soon as the first one made it to that point the next one came into view by Orion. They flew in succession like this one after the other until nine had passed by. The tenth one flew South to North.

Get a good amount of light pollution from Chicago so unusually visible stars...on my front porch moon was bright Venus was very bright to the right of the moon in the west north west sky...I hear my neighbor say this is so weird its so bright she is on the street in front of my house I say that's Venus and before I could finish saying Venus in see what she is talking about and it ended up being the starlink satellites but at that point I didn't know what they were so I immediately start having a panic attack this last for about 4 to 6 min then all the lights are gone now...because of lockdown I had a friend bring hand sanitizer to me he arrives and I'm trying to explain the lights I just saw so we are looking in the sky and I see one or two lights that were about the size of the star links and these are also moving but not in the straight line ""train"" path the ones I was trying to describe to him. I'm still a little frantic from the starlink because I still didn't know they were satellites still at this point so I'm pointing in the sky showing where they appeared and where they disappeared. As I am pointing to where the starlink disappeared in the south eastern part of the sky about 30 degrees up I see a single ""orb"" at first glance I said what the hell is that... Then ask my buddy and his brother what is that do you guys see that.. Then my brain trying to figure out what it is and its kinda behind a tree and the first thing I can think of is Chinese candle lantern but its way too big and way to high and its orange glowing around the outside of the circular object and gets darker towards the middle almost black in the middle but not quite it was just very dark deep orange. Now there is no sound its silent and moving slow across the sky but about the speed a commercial jet goes across the sky which is easy to compare being only 15 miles from Chicago midway airport we see jets all day and all night every day....but that's the speed it seems to be moving at as it crosses the sky no elevation change but as it gets mor to the south west part of the sky at 30 degrees still it stops and hovers for about a minute the continued on same path it was on until it disappeared into the horizon. The entire 5 to 7 min we 3 saw it we are all asking each other what the f is it and take turns dismissing everything it isn't ""plane helicopter lantern drone balloon comet asteroid meteor and so on now b4 it disapeard over the horizon about the time it was hovering my friend was so scarred from my discription of starlink and the sight of this ""orb"" he and his brother leave. my friend tells his brother we need to get inside something is going on and we need to get home...now again I'm by myself and about 2 to 7 min later the second round of starlink return and then i decide yea its time to get in the house before this alien invasion begins... So after a few min in the house my cousin says that she was on the phone with a friend from her congregation art church saw the first round of starlink and googled it and said that it was starlink so then I Google starlink and get some relief from my episode of panic about an invasion but I have no explanation for the orange orb we saw in the time between the starlink sightings it was certainly not anything from this world and am reporting it to see if myself and my two friends are the only ones to see this UFO on this night and to see if there have been sightings of similar ""crafts"" reported from other sightings before or after my sighting.

MUFON,2020-03-26 9:00PM,6/10/20,,Orland,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Tonigh I Observed one light above a 45 degree inclination staring from the northwest and ending at a higher inclination while still moving in same direction. Noticed once almost directly above head roughly at a 90 degree inclination the light began to dim out and vanish and I immediately noticed another coming from the same direction as the first came. The second was the same brightness and moving at same speed it seemed it was just moved over to the northwest more it seemed in relation to stars in sky. This light also dimmed out as its inclination got close to 90 degrees. I could not track these lights once they dimmed out thinking if these were Starlink I would still be able to see them falling back down in inclination to the southeast. I never saw them again in sky after they dimmed out before almost above my head. I look back an see a third light following the path of second same brightness an speed as the two before. This also dims out where the last two did and also never seen going down the horizon. Then a forth but from the path of the first more to true north. After this I call my Dad outside to take a quick look I catch one that he didnt see it dims out almost above our heads. I spot another rising I line up my arm to his shoulder he spots it an sees it too. He also noticed how it dims out and doesnt see it going down horizon. I spot another we line up an he sees this one also. We say Starlink? He goes to get his glasses an turns off the outside light. I see two more by this time one dims out as he comes back we looked lights off with eyes peeled to the sky and nothing. We go back inside saying could be satellites but then we both are convinced its possibly something else. I go to immediately to try to debunk it being UFOs checking Satflare and findstarlink. To my surprise there was a low visibility fly over of one the main trains there is just a few problems. The inclination of possible visibilty from my location of Houston TX 77061 which was very low from 10 to 20 degrees. The inclination of lights me and my Dad both saw were much higher. The starlink has been seen all around the world by now and is confirmed that it's very bright in the night sky. These lights were hard to see through Houston city lights and near by airport I could bearly see them as well as my Dad. It's been known that the trains seperation or spacing is very close and its been recorded how close they follow each other. The lights we saw had a very slow duration of the next in line the spacing was great and not tightly packed together. Being that Starlink is bright an has been seen entering and leaving the horizon through bright city lights my Dad and I tend to think since the lights we saw never left the horizon the possibility of it being Starlink is very low.

MUFON,2020-04-22 3:41PM,6/6/20,,Tampa,FL ,FLORIDA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I wanted to get a decent picture of Jupiter and Mars this morning but there was too much cloud cover to see either planet with the naked eye. I was getting ready to pack up my stuff when I saw a flash in the sky like a meteor. Then I sort of saw another one but there's a decent cloud cover so I thought I might have just seen a star through a small break in the clouds those two flashes are the only things I actually saw all the lights in the video I assume were completely covered by clouds I sure couldn't see them. There's four or five lights that seem to travel the same path sort of like Starlink but the angle and direction they're traveling in are totally off for something like a satellite. At 2:08 right after the screen goes blank for a second (I think I walked in front of the camera by accident I was moving around trying to see whatever my camera was seeing) the last one shows up but instead of moving in the same straight line it suddenly takes a FAST sharply angled turn then continues on it's way down. The video quality isn't the best I was too preoccupied with trying to see these things with my own eyes to fiddle around with the settings on my phone so I'm sending both the original and a version with better exposure and sharpness and no audio. One of my favorite things to do is capturing cool stuff that happens in the night sky I got a really awesome shot of Venus' conjunction with the Pleaides Cluster a couple of months ago a great one of the ISS sailing in between Saturn and Jupiter last week. I know how to take night pictures and I've never seen anything like this before. Thank you for your time and if there is a non-freaky explanation for this . It would be huge relief to me.

Approximately 21:45 we noticed a line of what appeared to be stars coming up from the northwest horizon and extending up to almost overhead. These lights were in a line from Northwest to Southeast. They were separated by a distance of 1.5 palm lengths. We stared at them for a moment then realized they were moving. They were moving from NW to SE (120 deg) at a consistent regular velocity. Their separation was steady. Later we noticed at about number ""30"" that the distance was greater and that they had started to move more to the South. We stood in amazement so I decided to get my kids and they also stood and watched the event. We counted 37 objects give or take and they were about magnitude 3 in brightness. I later learned that these may have been the deployment of SpaceX Starlink 5 G Sat. System. I also learned that at project completion there may be over 12000 of these.

Clouds were rolling in and out this probably went on close to an hour I'm guessing 25+ were what we say. All I can assume is this is part of the new Starlink satellite system... which is fine but it was quite unnerving actually seeing some weird things going on in the sky. 5 Witnesses neighbors and my wife. We tried to get cell phone video but none had good enough resolution. I'll keep an eye out for awhile if they are satellites we'll probably get some sort of ""yes this is Elon Musk's plan"" thing.

MUFON,2020-03-26 5:54AM,4/1/20,,Kenwood,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Me and my mother were smoking 9n our back porch when she pointed up and asked me what's that? She often does as I'm very familiar with objects in the night sky. (Armature astronomer and astrophotograper) the siting took place around 8:30 pm and lasted roughly until 8:50 I believe the objects were most likely man made they followed the same path just under Jupiter moving to just under Orion's belt. The objects moved like satellites my mom counted 15 and stopped counting I counted about 25 and stopped. They were perfectly spaced apart and on the same path as a row of starlink would be. The issue is that I follow just about every thing that goes on in astronomy and all things space related. I enjoy it! :) They moved like a sat would and just like I imagined starlink would. The issue is that SpaceX does not have that many objects up yet. I believe the objects to be in L.E.O. (low earth orbit) because I have seen all kinds of sats passing by in my experience looking through and eyepiece of my scopes. Perhaps there's more objects that SpaceX has than have tood us idk. But it was clearly in L.E.O. because its was dark on the ground and and I know how after dark up to an hr hr 1/2 the sun's still up and can be seen in L.E.O. the objects were bright at first much like a satellite then dimmed to the point were you could not see them. They kept coming moving at a speed I would say was a bit faster than most sats move. The color was the same as the color that reflects off of sats comets m.i.r. and the iss. There was no coulds at the time 2 other aircraft in the skys at the time. Anyways I never have reported before but thought it was interesting. My mother felt very uneasy but she's also not used to looking up as much as me. After about ten mins we alerted my brother who was doing school work for his master's degree. Anyways I'm currently cleaning the optics on my celeron 130gt newtonian reflector and trying to get it to connect to my laptop. So if I'm able to get them again you will have still pics and videos. I use a 20 to 25 mm eyepiece and a 2x Barlow the and a cell phone adapter and phone on pro mode as I adjust the iso for conditions light pollution ect ect. Also it will be on a very stable mount and I use a remote capture device to take the pics start and stop vids ect ect. Very strange ....

MUFON,2020-03-26 7:45PM,3/27/20,,San Rafael,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report During the streamed launch of SpaceX Starlink 3/18/2020 during the decent of first stage rocket and seconds before the re-entry burn an object is seen from under the rocket. The object is either stationary and the rocket is falling passed it or the object is traveling in a vertical direction (unknown if up or down). It appears to have the shape of a dodecahedron and silver-grey metallic surface that is reflective (yet not mirror reflective). The link I am submitting is the video I clipped from SpaceX youtube posting. I have the original post in the description and the time stamp the object appears. There is no reaction by any of the SpaceX announcers and no comment ever made of it. This object was Danger close to their reentry vehicle and would expect some sort of report on it. Thank you.

MUFON,2020-03-24 8:33PM,3/24/20,,Maumelle,AR ,ARKANSAS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report At approximately 9:05 PM on March 15 2020 my son was in my backyard with his dog. He saw a strange white light flying high in the night sky. He decided to record it with his phone. While following the white light he began to notice a purple plasma type light forming in the northeastern sky. The white light flew into the purple light. The purple light quickly disappeared. He came into the house and told my husband and I about his experience. He showed us the video. We asked him to take us outside and show us where he saw the purple light. When looking into the sky we saw what seemed to be dozens of small white lights traveling from the west to the east. They were not like the train of lights you would see with Starlink. They were kind of scattered and far apart. Some skipped across the sky while others were smooth and steady all heading in the direction where the purple light had been. We watched the lights for about 10 to 15 minutes. They were gone. Confused and in awe of what we had all seen we kept staring into the sky. After 10 minutes or more we saw a massive triangular shaped craft coming from the east. It flew as high as a jumbo jet but was almost translucent but not. It's edges were a misty fuzzy glowing green. It's hard to explain. We are trying to reason what we saw but just can't. Content-type: text/html,,{rjl} Can't be starlink,starlink,,"Maumelle,AR "
MUFON,2020-03-18 8:17AM,3/22/20,,Cape Canaveral,FL ,FLORIDA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report My family and I were driving from Lancaster to Circleville on St. Rt 188 at 1912 hours on March 5th when we noticed an orange orb of light appear and disappear on the Southside of St Rt 188 between St Rt 674 and Amanda Northern Road. Confused and intrigued by what we had just seen we stopped at my parents’ house on Ringgold Northern Road to see if we could observe anything else from their driveway. After looking for a few minutes we decided to continue back on St Rt 188 to home. Then at 1935 hours on March 5th we noticed what appeared to be a military helicopter hovering at low altitude on the North side of St Rt 188 where Winchester intersects. A quarter mile passed the helicopter proceeding towards Circleville 6 to 7 Orbs of orange light appeared in the sky out instantaneously. The orbs would appear and disappear almost as if the light was collapsing inward upon itself and did so for about 10-12 seconds before disappearing completely from existence. The orbs maintained a low altitude probably just a few hundred feet and appeared to be hovering yet slightly moving to the south east. This was not the starlink satellites recently launched. I know what those look like this was unlike anything we had seen before.

MUFON,2021-03-10 4:45AM,3/14/21,,montesano,WA ,WASHINGTON,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report On or about June of 1983 I and my then girlfriend where sitting on the hood of my old car and enjoying the view of the Hudson River from a great vantage point on the grounds of a historic site called The Cloisters. It’s located on the Manhattan side about a quarter mile North of the George Washington Bridge. The night was warm and very clear. At first we clearly saw a 300 ft merchant ship traveling by at around 10 nots. We could see port holes light bulbs and and railings with no trouble. After 5 to 10 minutes things got very interesting and odd at the same time. We at first where confused when we saw a string of lights at a distance stretching almost straight across the river. We thought they where all police boats sailing side by side possibly searching the river. But as the lights came closer we noticed that the lights weren’t on the river but above it. And more they started growing not in brightness but in size! We where mesmerized at the intense but not intense lights as they grew as large as a three story house in diameter. Blue green yellow and red. No light was splashing on the water. More like a contained light. Comparable to a curtained window. We saw at least eight across and about 50 to 100 feet above the river. The shape appeared to stretch across the river maybe for at least 1500 feet maybe more. The thickness seemed to be at a minimum of 100 or more feet and it took at least three to four minutes to pass us. It was hard to determine the exact shape because it seemed that whatever coated the surface was completely light absorbing. It was more the lights across being blocked from across the river as this massive shadow slowly passed a few feet over the trees following the river until we lost sight of it actually passing directly under the George Washington Bridge. Another observation was that the lights seemed to be facing down at around a 25 to 30 degrees and it seemed or felt like the lights seemed to be working like a massive viewer or like we would watch a video camera to view the outside world. But three dimensional. It made no sound. Seemed to levitate consistently without up or down down motion heading towards the Bridge. We could see the traffic on the bridge and expected the traffic to stop but it seemed that none did. It has been many years and the memories of the event resurfaces every time I here or see anything or anyone mention ufo. But I also noticed that this Hudson Valley UFO was never reported anywhere near New York City let alone seen cross under one of the most famous bridges in the world. So we may be the only eyewitnesses to prove it actually reached Manhattan and New Jersey! Content-type: text/html,,observed a string of 12 to 15 lights,string of,,"montesano,WA "
MUFON,2020-12-04 7:20AM,3/1/21,,Jefferson City,MO ,MISSOURI,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was looking out my window at the stars and noticed a string of red flashing lights above my home coming from the SW heading NE. At first I thought it was a reflection on the window from Christmas lights until I realized they were moving. I thought they may be helicopters however there was no sound at all. I observed them until they disappeared over the NE horizon. They did change formation from a straight line into a grouped pattern. Some lights would disappear and then others appeared. I managed to get a video the lights were much redder than the video shows. The very last light was larger and brighter and also flashed white along with red but it did not appear to be a plane or other aircraft. I took a photo of my star map during the incident to confirm it was not starlink. I’ve witnessed several star link chains and this did not resemble them at all.

They would seem to pivot and go north snd disappesr as each came to a singular spot in the night sky. They did not appear as close together as the Star Link satellites and seemed to move across the sky and then pivot. Watched them for about 5 minutes. They did not blink.

I noticed what appeared to be a string of star like objects (just to the right of planets mentioned). They were in a vertical / angular formation slowly moving across the sky in a NW direction. They could have been mistaken for stars except they were in a formation and moving across the sky. They were moving slowly enough that I went back into the house to get my wife to see the objects. By the time we returned they were traveling upwards and disappearing one at a time (top object first). I stayed for awhile to see if they might reappear but didn't witness anything.

MUFON,2020-12-04 6:15PM,12/5/20,,Aptos,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report At about 5:15 AM this morning I walked out of my house and looked up at the stars as I always do and noticed what looked to be a bright meteor streak. But I noticed it did not fade as they usually do and it was moving. I saw it directly over head and traveling very slowly toward the southeast. I would estimate a land speed of about 15-20 mph. It was a continuous narrow string of lights. Each next to the other. It was very long and occupied about 10 degrees of the sky as observed from the ground. It was low. about the altitude of an airplane. It made absolutely no sound. We live in a very quiet place next to the Cleveland National Forest. You can hear a leaf drop especially early in the morning but this made no sound. Even a blimp would make some noise. Since it was dark I could not see any other shape other than the string of lights I saw it from overhead going form a northeast to a southeast direction. My observation lasted about a minute and a half to two minutes. It finally traveled out of sight behind the mountains and below my horizon. This was nothing like the starlink lights which I see often and which are very high and about 2 - 3 degrees apart as observed from the earth. It was also not a meteor which as an armature astronomer I see often. This was clearly an object traveling slowly and silently across the sky until it moved out of sight behind the San Vicente mountain to the southeast.

MUFON,2020-12-04 7:20PM,12/4/20,,Star,ID ,IDAHO,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report At 2000 (8 pm) while looking at Andromeda galaxy I glimpsed a streak of light stationary to the north. I grabbed my binoculars 12x50 and looked at the streak. It turned out to be a string of lights approximately 20 to 30 pointed in a south east direction as viewed from my location. The lights were about 15 degrees above the ground just below and left of Polaris. I then turned my spotting scope 20x60 in the direction the lights and spotted the lights moving at a high rate of speed to the south east. The lights were all the same size and same distance apart moving in the same direction. (My guess is they were outside the atmosphere because as they travelled to the southeast they disappeared as if loosing reflection from the sun.) There was not enough time to make a positive identification other than what I have printed here. Atmospheric conditions were excellent for viewing as a cold front had passed be the night before. No clouds no atmospheric distortion other than normal earth curvature. No drugs or alcohol involved before or after the sighting. The aircraft involved was a commercial plane moving in a north direction (possibly heading to San Antonio international airport). The aircraft appeared shortly after the lights disappeared. My interest is has anyone else seen this or a similar set of lights and can they be verified better than my description?

The lights were grouped in a vertical row - large dull white. We both said to each other ""what the heck is that?""

I looked up to the sky and saw a series of 7 lights moving in unison in a straight line from northwest to southeast. The lights were grouped such that there was a single light in the lead followed by 3 sets of tandem lights all spacing appeared equal and remained equal as they traveled across the sky. As soon as I saw the strange lights I quickly ran back in the house and awoke my wife and had her come look. When we got back outside the lights were still moving in unison in the same direction and still equally spaced. At this time there appeared another light which seemed smaller in size but moving much faster it was traveling from southwest to northeast it seemed to be at a higher altitude and seemed to pass over the string of lights. My wife said grab your phone. I grabbed my phone and tried to record video but I don't think there was enough light. I would describe it like someone was pulling a string. My wife described it as like a train. So it was one light followed by a space then a pair of lights with a space in between the pair.

MUFON,2020-08-16 11:39PM,10/1/20,,Chetek,WI ,WISCONSIN,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report 4:30am I was getting in my car and looked up. Very high in the dark sky there was a thin twinkling line moving from west to east. The line was made up what looked like tightly clustered stars all in a line moving about as quickly as a jet liner or fast moving satellite. There was no noise it did not leave a tail like Hale-Bopp or Neowise. It was a distinctly shaped as a line with small ""twinkles"" for each light in the string. I say twinkles because each ""light"" or ""dot"" didn't flash but had more of the quality and color of a twinkling star. Each of the lights or twinkles were tightly spaced enough to appear as a 'line"" moving through the sky. The whole sighting lasted only a few minute as it dipped behind a cloud and reappeared. I did try to take a picture of it with my cell phone but camera did not pick up any of the stars or the object in question. Size/distance - Unknown length of the object appeared to be about as long as an average finger or around 3 inches. Color - White with the twinkle quality of stars Shape - Simple thin line of star like twinkles Unable to count how many lights or twinkles in the string. If I had to guess maybe a dozen or more. Speed - Fast jet liner or fast moving satellite. Quality - Silent movement peacefully moving no tails wisps emissions or other oddities. Simplified analogy - Looked like seeing a string of Christmas lights in the distance.... individual points of light as a line or string tightly spaced together. Personal Perspective - Since it was 4:30am the sun was almost over the horizon but still dark. An object in the upper atmosphere or out side of the atmosphere would likely be illuminated. The length of the line versus distance is of wonder. To be around 3"" in length and that far away it must have been extensive.

MUFON,2020-08-07 4:30AM,8/7/20,,Oakville,WA ,WASHINGTON,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report At 3:07 a.m. on June 22nd ( the early morning of the day after Father’s Day 2020 my significant other and I were relaxing in the hot tub. She’s a nocturnist (night doc) so we are often up late. We have a clear view of the eastern sky. I was wide awake and gazing East. She was dozing. Suddenly in the due East sky about 45 degrees above the horizon I saw a descending light like a shooting star but much slower. ( We had seen shooting stars earlier in the evening. They travel quickly and burn out fast.) This light was traveling almost perfectly vertically only a slight tilt to the north of due East. Then I saw another and another and another all following the exAct same linear path. Not parallel paths but the identical path was being traversed by all of them. I excitedly said “ look look!” My girlfriend snapped to and watched the parade of descending lights. As the lead light descended it faded out and another one would simultaneously appear on the end of the train of evenly spaced lights. Four or five were visible at any one time but the train kept renewing itself with the lead light fading out and another taking its place at the top end of the trIn of lights. I counted a total of eighteen lights before they all faded out one by one as they got closer to the eastern horizon. I jumped out of the tub and ran into the house and checked the. Time on the clock on the stove: 3:08 a.m. June 22 2020. I am very familiar with meteors. I taught astronomy for 32 years. These were traveling much slower descending nearly vertically toward the eastern horizon not across the sky parallel to the surface as meteors tend to do. Not only were they traveling slower than any meteor I have ever seen but the illuminated points of light were all traveling the exact same path the front one always faded away and additional lights simultaneously appeared on the trailing end of the linear trajectory. Re-entering satellite debris follows a single direction of travel but is spread out. It also flashes brightly and leaves a trail of glowing debris like a meteor. These objects had no tails no flashes of glowing debris and no wake. It was as though We were seeing an organized formation of objects entering the atmosphere on the exact same flight path. The Travel vector is approximately consistent with Mt. Adams some 60 miles distant. I called my pal Rob Johnson the next day. He studies this stuff. He thought it might be a comm satellite or a string of such things being released by Elon Musk’s Space X thingy but he checked and could not find any record of launches on Father’s Day weekend. Also if it was a satellite launch it didn’t go well because the objects were descending toward earth. 18 objects is a lot of satellites. Repeat: they were not incinerating due to friction with the atmosphere. It appeared to be very precise and controlled descent all on the exact same vector. I have seen satellites and space stations travel the sk at night. They travel parallel to the curvature of the earth. These bad boys were entering the atmosphere heading almost straight down and in the rough direction of Mt. Adams or another peak in the crest of the Cascades. Hope this helps.

MUFON,2020-06-16 4:10AM,6/16/20,,Barstow,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report Now I'm writing this down many years after what I had originally witnessed. Reason being somewhat unknown to myself why I didn't go off the wall when this happened. Any how I have known what I saw for aprox. 10 years my memory fails me on what year 2006 or 2007 it was but I do know the 3 of us we were lighting off small little smoky things that leave a wormy ash shell on our front stairs and maybe few other spark fountains and stuff so I'm pretty sure it was the 4th of July to boot. Now before I get into the details I would just like to give some background as to how I came about to this point. Before this event happened I had heard stories of the phoenix lights but that said I never bothered to look into it had no idea what they looked like other than maybe knowing they were lights as seen on the local news. And to top it off I just thought they were separate lights with no structure and appeared to be random string of lights I gave no merit to it and certainly never thought about them or ufos just had no real interest as I don't think I was a believer of such things plus I had young daughter I had a good amount of time with and the reason I had moved to Arizona but I didn't have her that day. So moving on to say that even after I witnessed this amazing event reasons unknown to me other then I might have been so caught up in child custody and parenting and career stress I never bothered to look into it however it did worm its way into my mind from time to time but again it didn't register. Now weirder yet as I watched this beast of a craft pass my view for all my years on this earth I could not relate it to anything I ever saw or imagined but for all its glory all I said after was ""ok wow huh I just really did see an ufo mammoth something out of star wars space craft of sorts"" I knew this was important and felt our military needed to know what is out there because it’s such a huge complex craft I have no doubt it could wipe out anything anyone had. After this I looked at Roommate and Girlfriend standing next to me on stairs I said did you guys just see that. You had to of seen that right. I think my roommate merely said I think I saw something. Girlfriend says she not sure if she saw any thing but they were talking to each other. I noticed that neither one of them were very emotional about it to say they saw something but funny I didn’t know the resource to call upon to do that so I held off as I thought how can I find the right place to report this. I pretty much shrugged it off for appearances sake no one would believe what I just saw but I know what I saw and that's all that matters. I don’t know why I saw it and many a night prayed to my lord god asking why he let me clearly witness this thing. So I don't know what that makes me anymore but I never questioned what I saw other than I felt I was truly special and lucky but now questioning how does it affect my faith. But surprisingly it strengthened it in that there is more to life then we know. I ask God many a day's why he let me see that what does that mean to me and to him ? will he forsake me because I accidently caught sight of something that challenges areas of my faith? I don't know I still struggle with it trying to draw parallels between my faith and what I saw. Its opened a whole new reality for myself but I embrace it because I know I feel on to something that could be beyond current understanding. Continuing on what I feel is Ironic about this is strangely I never perused it but it began to make me hungry to know more and just what do we as a civilization know about things. Thus my hungry research sparked me to look to YouTube and just to type in and see what comes up.. Well lull and behold the Phoenix lights showed up along with countless of other sightings. Well I concentrated on watching the phoenix lights video from the news because I'm in phoenix so that made sense as good starting point. Sure enough the video shows lights now if you remember before I witnessed what I did I had no clue on Phoenix lights they seemed random to me however it took me a second before I knew exactly exactly what It was because it was exactly structure shape of the craft that I saw that fits that light formation. Only I saw it in detail close up and during a time of night that it was still not totally dark..I was floored.. I felt like I was just raised above the level of all those people who say they saw UFO phoenix lights in 1997 only amazingly I saw it in I'm estimating 2006 07 08. ( Darn really wished I documented this earlier...) I saw the real deal that fills the gap between the phoenix lights in full detail. Now you may ask why am I bothering to give you all this surrounding detail about the event but it's for several of reasons: 1. for myself to finally write something on paper about this rather than just stuck in minds memory 2. to show I am a regular guy with other things important to his life and 3. if it helps others confirm bring closure on their suspicions of the phoenix lights seen in march 1997. 4. If it helps to identify needed detail about it for national security reasons or just about any other reason it Just makes sense to put on paper and leave it to the experts to fight it out.. I have to admit as my internet research as sparked a couple years ago and I have explored the many sightings. I am quick to point out or I feel many aren't real because they are not what I saw that was real it's pretty cut and dry for me as I know what I saw. This long extended research has made some areas of my detail memory fuzzy with the emotion mixed with varying degrees of remembered facts as I see them and the fact that it's been etched in my mind for so long and then to realize for me there is an emotional aspect to what I saw a feeling that comes with knowing I'm right as I watch other videos of sightings trying to find if anyone has detail footage as I have memory of this enormously huge craft. But as god is my witness with what I saw there is more to this craft then you know or see in the photos published online. I can also tell you the testimony of that couple on YouTube is closest I have found to what I saw along with the video of the guy wearing sunglasses that says he was delivering pizzas except I saw more detail and slight variations and about 10 years later.. I can tell you it has changed my life as it has resolved me to investigate what's out there in areas of science religion history and mostly now technology past and present. If you want a kid to want to learn more. Have them witness a detailed sighting as mine. :) Anyhow I of course feel concerned about going public with this for obvious reasons I don't want this to ruin my life .. ex. men in black show up etc... but being that this is what it is and so far has only improved my understanding of the world around me I think ok to tell plus I feel like I am more and more unable to contain myself to wanting to tell the world about what I witnessed any longer.. Ok Fair enough time to get into the details of what I saw Now mind you this took place approx. 15 seconds tops but long enough I still have the main conceptual detail of it. It was late evening maybe 8pm still not total dark plenty of light available to see detail. I remember a Clinton had come to Phoenix either Hillary or Bill for some reason that day (maybe that can help me figure out what day it was.). Which also sparked me to think if this thing was there to protect the president or candidate cant remember but later I gave up on that theory… Anyhow We (3 of us) were standing on my front stairs(set of 3 stairs) on the south side of the townhouse my roommates unit D I was in (just for specific location if needed later). We had just finished lighting off smoky little firework and went back to the higher stair of the 3 stairs to continue conversation with roommate and my gf that were on the lower stairs or ground level. They were facing pretty much west as I was facing Easterly direction and for whatever reason I was gazing just slightly above their elevation conversely listing when I caught a glimpse out of corner of my eye something huge starting to move over the flat roof tops off into my view and oddly completely silent like it didn’t even care if it was seen. Kind of like watching a film with no sound and a people conversation going in the background my eyes then shifted and this is the part of my testimony I thought about not including only because It made no sense to me whatever logically and anyone trying to understand this might be tainted to not want to hear the rest of my testimony.. I have now decided to tell this pare as there may be logical explanation or not. and here goes. As I saw the beginning emerging mass starting to move over the rooftops what took shape to me was the quintessential looking flying saucer with lights flashing around in sequence an antenna hanging either underneath or on top can’t remember I would venture it was the bottom. Just smack dab in my view. Clear as a bell you could not mistake it for anything else. It was a flying saucer so it appeared... Now this is where it gets tricky I don’t recollect seeing the transition between this flying saucer and what comes next but I know it was the first thing I saw and I can’t recall seeing the flying saucer attached to anything. Anyways Then this dark mass moved in behind it very close or maybe almost touching (strangely looked as if this mass was being Towed by the flying saucer I thought to myself) as wired as it was. Stunningly it was different altogether that started filling my view but I could tell it was Flat low profile in thickness except for maybe a very very slight hump up toward the top front I tried to see but not a good view just barely made it out. . Of course I could not make heads or tails of this shape until later in my viewing but at that point I had no idea what I was I was looking at. I remember the front of this new emerging shape was maybe 3 lights clustered together near the very front. As more of the craft crept into view I could make out the lights pulsing back and forth on the front face of the crafts wings toward the center and then back down the wing again very ufo like... Behind the 3 lights up front of the craft was a 2 layered oval platforms levels with what appeared to be windows going around the bottom layer. The bottom layer was slightly smaller than the layer above it that attaches to the underbelly. (same structure for the command center I talk about later). Strangely I remember counting specifically only 2 layers. I gazed around for markings like USA China Russia etc.... did not see a anything to identify it only Dark Flat Black or darkest gray surface. I could not believe what my eyes for fixating on what appeared so huge and vast that looking east at the underbelly I couldn't see the other side and that appeared at least a block and half or more of my sight. The front tip(see footnote) had to be id say at lest a good block away maybe half block east of corner or Lake shore and South shore drive. How could it be going so smoothly slow without falling out of the sky. I remember sort of frantically searching with my eyes for something of detail that I could plainly recognize or make sense of .. but nothing … However during that searching of its vast underbelly off in the distance I found the center point of the giant mass structure that looked very small for the size of this craft but never the less it was there it looked like a double layer oval structure cylindrical maybe slightly oblique. Almost exactly the same shape as the toward front of the craft only under that layered area there was another area that at first thoughts looked kind of like the top of submarine with the long varied antennas only upside down. I noticed the flat smooth underbelly possibly also had low profile detail gradually increasing toward that center point. Obviously this was beyond what I could grasp I was thinking it had to be some country that was checking us or here to protect the president. But it can’t be ours because of its impossible size shape detail involved in this craft. I could also see beyond and behind the center hanging structure of the craft’s enormous underbelly surface world as it crept silently more into view there was Seemed. I noticed that the underbelly detail was very low profile Except for at least one flashing green red or yellow beacon that hung straight down almost directly over my head and maybe another one way further off in the vastness of the underbelly. Most distinctively without question was the Huge immense what I would describe as recessed light. I saw 3 that were on but I also noticed there were others not on and different sized low-profile recessed lighting possibilities as well along the bottom. I looked straight up into the one as it passed right directly over. That light did not cast down stayed contained inside the well as I looked very hard into the light source inside could almost appeared to be some sort of tight grid structure . It appeared as perfect white light that at that point it was directly over me. come to see it morph to a rusty orange after it passed by my upward gaze. As this craft literally blocked out my view of the sky and I started to see sky reappearing again toward and behind the upside-down hanging submarine part (which I can only imagine was like the command center). That area behind the center was extended out a ways past the area inside angle of the V which technically makes it a W although the middle hump looked big to me but in all actuality was very small after the craft passed by a ways to see the full structure ..it looked like flying carpenter square or an sideways L strangely the jutted out area was too small to make a difference of the overall shape from a distance. Back to looking up underneath it as it drifted forward more I could see night sky and stars but it was all somewhat fuzzy or distorted perhaps. Like the cloaking was just turned off but yet still turned on just a little. Then strangely I noticed a small red plum light trailing behind in the middle of the V toward the back not attached to anything I could see(thought that was odd even impossible) moving same speed of the craft yet I could still see the starts around the red plum light.. That red light may of actually been further out a litte ways from the the Very end of the V but hard to tell exactly when it ended. Redirecting my look to the back under edge of the Vs underbelly it merged into a distorted glazy looking surfaces of the tiles of sorts (this was amazing to me as immediately I told myself that’s got to be what they call cloaking how odd I’m not seeing thingy. It truly distorted) at the same I noticed hanging down was a grid of what look like 1 level of square scaffolding/tubes all under the belly of the craft... I sort of recall the scaffolding when looking directly up to near the large cylinder light. but it must have been large the spacing of it as it was over me I didn’t notice until I looked further toward the back of the wing where the glazy surface was where it appeared more tightly packed. By the time that final back edge area was over me I looked intently at It and it was still glazy glossy distorted surface. Now as quickly tried to ascertain the back area of this craft as it just started moving over me I caught sight of side area of the area extending back behind the center of the ve.. (the middle hump). It was either on that piece or the near back side of the left wing(as i call it) nearer to the center of V of the craft What I saw was a huge rectangular window that surprisingly look like I was looking into the side view of a windowed Mall corridor. It reminded me of a long viewing window maybe seen on the Battlestar Galactica. It was still far away but I could imagine people in there looking out and seeing literally everything as it glides over the rooftops. I did not see any people or aliens in that window. I also realized as it went over I was more to the very right side of this craft but still underneath. So it may of been the last Giant Recessed light that went over me on that right wing But as I traced my view up to the center light toward the front I I did see at least one recessed light not being used (see footnote later on the front) V. I think one of the last things I saw from being under it was the passing of the end of the right wing and what struck me was the perfect I mean extremely perfect 90 right angle of right end of the wing tip it appeared to be. Then as last end of right wing passed over me I looked forward facing where the center of the craft would be only center was gone moved by but then what I did see just incredibly floored me and that was that left wing had not passed me yet instead it stretched out so far away that I think the atmosphere made craft look a lighter shade of gray and hazy because it was so far away maybe air pollution or dust in the air. And strangely enough looking at that wing off in the gray distance of the air. I recall a quick view fainting image of almost similar to the layers of buildings similar to that on aircraft carrier settled on top toward the back 1/3 of the wing. Now a few other things this monster was extremely thin and low profile to its overall size. The side views that I did see I imaged has to be several stories in thickness(guest a guess) it looked almost exactly just like the side of a star Destroyer from movie Star Wars. Kind of like thick level on top and below and recessed side in between with a lot of detail hard to make out Except that window area I saw. that was because closer to the center of the V . Of course I couldn't notice the huge angled shape of the craft until it moved far enough past me abit. What I noticed was it looks like a Giant Flying Carpenter Square of all things Tri Square shaped with one side noticeably longer then the other drifting at a consistent pace from maybe one invisible point to another invisible point almost appearing to slightly hesitate at points for microsecond which gave the sense of something ever so slightly off. As it set off into the distance due south like it was following the 101 highway I remember staying focused on until the very last moment when I saw it angle a bit as if to head southwest and out of sight. I don’t get the strange shape but I do know Jesus was a carpenter. The Free Masons has that shape. It similar to a chevron shape of sorts found all over the place. I found document TR-6 Telos that shows is almost the Identical craft.. But the craft I saw appeared to be way bigger. So after my Roomate and Gf both acted passive to me asking them if they saw it.. so I guess I thought well then it was I whow was truly blessed to have seen it and I know what I saw is a miracle of someone’s technology Ill have to believe I was meant to see it.. I was way off under the right wing when I did witness this and thought maybe they didn’t see me or expect me to be seeing it.. because if was just for me to see why not have me directly under the middle of it. After time I realize This wasn’t meant for just me to see.. It was an accident of the cloaking failure it been being towed by a flying saucer or they showing this technology purposely to send a message ..(I have several theories what that message is) I have a several theories as to the origin of what I saw but no matter which one I choose I can tell you my reality filter is forever changed and my desire to find out what I witnessed keeps me going and that there is more to life then we know.. (its not the is this it now what mentality). I have researched this not as most people done reading books etc.. I have read parts of things if they seem to have a link but for me .. I know what I saw… I don’t have to dig very far.. I am able to sift through a thousand pictures or youtube videos or articles and able to quickly discern what is what I saw or not. There are a few things out there that have given me some ahh haa. moments that seem to connect a lot of dots for me or given me a very keen sense of history sightings of this mystery craft. I could go on and on about my new way I look at life how I see our government and other nations how I view the world around me knowing there is something out there bigger than life and anything I could of ever imagined and to know its true real present in our lifes whether it be seen or not. I know I can not be the only one who seen this .. But I do know I am one of the few who seen it in full Detail up close and personal only 10 years later 2006 or 2007 leaning toward 2007. Those phoenix lights from 1997 were very real and I saw everything they were and what connected it all in between. I almost wonder if this craft appears in 10 year increments as if being sent back from the future to let us know or give us something look forward to or something to be forewarned about .. It baffles the mind. But I know here is a reason because I know its so very real what I saw and I just sometimes feel I want everyone to know so we can stop messing around with all this other stuff and concentrate on find this thing again it has to be the solution for all mankind enveloped in this craft . Is it telling us we need to find our way into space and build spacecraft because our world will be eradicated ? . This implications of us seeing this craft can be scary sometimes as well as enticingly majestically enlightening. Content-type: text/html",,String of lights,string of,,"Barstow,CA "
MUFON,2020-06-16 4:40AM,6/16/20,,Tulsa,OK ,OKLAHOMA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report On April 30th at 9:00PM my wife and I observed between 30-40 points of light emerge to the right of Venus in a straight line formation. The lights were evenly spaced and moving SW from our position. Half way through the procession a single light pulled out of formation and remained stationary closer to Venus only to fall back into formation at the end of the line. The string of lights never entered Earth's atmosphere and remained in interplanetary space. The entire procession lasted all of 5 minutes as they traversed the sky from Venus (in the NW) to the Southeastern horizon.

MUFON,2020-06-03 9:40PM,6/15/20,,quincy,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was sitting on my deck on Tuesday 4/28/20 at approximately 830-930 pm looking west toward the Delaware River when I observed a string of silent oval lights flying south in a straight line (once in awhile you could observe a cluster of 2 or 3 objects flying together but primarily it was approximately 50-70 objects flying in a perfect straight line). I called for my husband to observe and he witnessed them too. The whole event lasted approximately 2 minutes from beginning to end. We called 3 local police departments in Ewing NJ Yardley PA and Lower Makefield Twp. PA and no one else reported any such sighting. We called Verge Aero (a drone company based on Philly that does light events). They had an event that night but the drones were assembled in Philly and he explained that we wouldn't even be able too see drones from the distance we were describing for 2 reasons: 1) drone lights aren't that big; and 2) drones are not allowed to fly above 400 feet. Additionally we live in extremely close proximity to the Trenton-Mercer airport NJ State Police Headquarters and a military installation. We are therefore well versed in what different lights in the sky look like. These were NOT helicopters airplanes drones private planes etc. They were silent lighted oval objects that were flying in a perfectly straight line numbering 50+. It was a highly unusual experience.

The objects look like a satellite as it would appear in the the night sky. They were mostly equidistant in spacing. However we all witnessed one of the orbs break off from the line and make a curving trajectory change towards the north changing its heading by approx. 90 degrees. The lights seemed to materialize and appear in the same spot of clear sky towards the South West approx every ten or fifteen seconds. The sighting lasted for about half an hour until 4:30; during this time dozens of orbs were witnessed. Myself and three others also witnessed a very similar string of lights from the Summit of Mount Battie on 4/19/2020 from approximately 9:00pm to 9:40pm. Prior to seeing the string of lights on 5/3/2020 we witnessed a reddish-whitish light flashing in an irregular manner towards the east over the ocean. It flashed on and off every few minutes about thirty degrees above the eastern horizon. This lasted for close to an hour before witnessing the string of orbs.

MUFON,2020-04-28 8:30PM,5/4/20,,West Trenton,NJ ,NEW JERSEY,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report After mistaking Venus a few months ago I was still looking in the sky. Saw 50+ ""stars"" going like a string of pearls so fast it had to be satellites. I was thinking UFO until I looked up on internet and saw they had launched all those Musk satellites and determined it must have been the latest launch since whole string was there and they were only a thumb (hand outstretched) apart. Now the last light in the group was not exactly aligned and not equidistant like all th others I had run inside to tell others and came back out and was watching as they passed straight overhead and the last one (the odd one) suddenly went perpendicular (south) so fast it left a line in the sky like a meteor except that the whole trail stayed glowing for a second and it was gone. So I didn't report it immediately because of finding out about the Musk satellites but tonight May 1 at 10pm I saw more of the Musk satellites. About 4 or 5 in a string a handwidth to the left 4 or 5 more and a handwidth to the left another one. So I'm guessing that these strings are breaking apart and the trajectories are starting to skew a bit. Made me re-analyze the odds of a meteor leaving such a short trail from the end of that first string is beyond all odds of occurrence so I'm thinking that a UFO was following hat string of satellites and then shot off south. My wife managed to see the last 6 of the string as it disappeared east but was looking out the back window and could not have seen the light streak I saw directly above.

MUFON,2020-05-03 3:00AM,5/4/20,,Camden,ME ,MAINE,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report 4-30-2020 9:15 PM. The sighting originated from the northwest and arced to the southeast. We observed a string of starlike lights all of uniform brilliance and all in a perfect line. The vast majority of the lights were in uniform spacing except for a couple of instances. The line traveled as though on the end of a huge wheel. The formation originated at approximately 310 compass degrees on the high horizon and reached its apogee directly overhead. They were also in a single file formation and travelled at a moderate but steady pace. Of the approximately 30 lights two in the middle were close to each. The last two lights were closer to each other but the last light was out of line and slightly offset to the north. The stars seemed to disappear once they were on the high horizon to the southeast. These lights were lights were the size and brilliance comparable to the Capella star in the Auriga constellation. The entire sighting lasted a little more than 2 minutes.

MUFON,2020-05-02 9:00PM,5/3/20,,Crown Point,IN ,INDIANA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Tonight I went to check out a couple of bright lights one was a plane and the other must have been a planet? There was a line of three or four planets beside the moon. But moving across the line of planets were these smaller white lights. They were in a straight line one after the other like a string of Christmas lights. They moved upward toward the moon and I couldn't see them after they reached the area of the sky that has glow around the moon. I couldn't tell where they came from because of trees but they were moving diagonally from about 25 degrees to about 60 degrees estimated. They were the size planes would be but equa-distant straight line no noise no flashing lights. Just white lights.I counted at least 20( twenty) of them. So moving in a straight line diagonally across the sky toward the moon. They were moving pretty fast. Slow enough to count but faster than a plane would be I believe.

MUFON,2020-04-27 9:02PM,5/1/20,,Sinking Spring,PA ,PENNSYLVANIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was watering plants outside clear sky looking at moon when I noticed 6 to 8 star like points of light traveling in a perfectly straight line from the lower portion of the horizon to the general direction of the moon. At first I thought it was a satellite untill I noticed the other lights following. They were moving faster than what an airplane would move across the sky but not so fast that they couldn’t be spotted. I tried to text my friends real quick and called my wife on speed dial to hurry up and look outside at the ufos. But by the time she got out side the last two had disappeared into the same dead zone in the sky. The string of lights were on a definite straight path and before they crossed the moons light the lead light disappeared. As the other approached they each did the same at the same location. No other planes in the sky during this witness. Clouds came in shortly there after Total time visible was maybe 12 secs. I missed the initial travel path of the lights and feel as if I caught the end of the destination. Content-type: text/html,,Following Elon Musk satellites,string of,,"Sinking Spring,PA "

They were in a string in an 45-90 degree arch from the height of a telephone pole to the moon and dark sky. They ascended evenly space passed were I could see the moon and disappeared one by one. As the last one disappeared their was an apparent aircraft flying lower then the appearance of the moon in a northerly direction aircraft was audible. The sky was clear to the west of my property but severe thunderstorms with lots lightning to the east winds were approximately 30-40 miles per hour with higher gusts. I can’t believe what I saw. Makes no sense. Unless they launched multiple satellites. I live very near SAFB. I’m puzzled. I’m hoping someone else saw these lights and I’m looking for an explanation.

MUFON,2020-04-29 9:35PM,4/29/20,,Deltona,FL ,FLORIDA,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report Hello Dear associate Myself and my GF were looking at the neighbour's bats which we only seen one last night april 28th 2020 . As we continued to look for them we noticed a shooting star we believed we saw but then it made a right turn then two more followed all within 10 seconds the first one went straight then made a right turn in a curve and disappeared in the clouds the second and third one followed . At this point we were baffled because a satellite or astronaut poop "" shooting star "" won't make a right turn. Now I'm not familiar with the hole star alignment but we had a quarter moon last night . So the bright star on the right from the moon aligned up with the shiny part of the moon and aligned with two more stars the big dipper handle was on our left . The handle of the big dipper the first two would align with were we seen the three objects making a right turn . This was around 21:18 or close at this time give or take 2+ - minutes . I've tried researching this but all I can find is the string of lights. But I can not find anything we're from all of a sudden a going straight that theese lights stars make a right turn . Any ideas ? Just curious here on what we saw ofcourse we told our kids and they just think we crazy . My friends told me yesterday that the pentagon had released some Videos the same day . For me I have never seen anything like this before and I like watching events like the space shuttle flying by but usually its cloudy here to watch any star showers. Anyways this was pretty cool to see and maybe you have some one else that also seen this last night april 28th 2020 around 21:18 +- 2 min Thank You for Your time Content-type: text/html",,String of lights perfect straight line heading into moon direction then all fading out at the same point in the sky as they approached it one by one.,string of,image.jpg,"Deltona,FL "

I pointed to the sky and my wife witnessed them as well. We were looking west and noticed them appear from the NW (3/4 of the way from the horizon to the cresent moon apparent this evening) traveling SE as if towards MD/DC area. There was no sound.They just kept appearing in a line heading the same direction. Some were solo and some were in groups of two. At the end - one changed direction and traveled the opposite direction at a very high rate of speed. I have seen satellites in the night sky before and this reminded me of them but were definitely different in movement - plus there were so many of them.

We saw at least 30 lights; we’re not sure how many preceded our first sighting. Lights appeared to be same size and color of commercial jets without any flashing lights. We didn’t know their altitude making it impossible to estimate size. These lights were very close to each other and usually had a pattern of two lights small break and then another two. Two or three times there was a group of three before a small space. It took 60-90 seconds for lights to go from horizon to horizon. Lighs color & intensity was exactly same for all lights; lights never changed intensity size or shape. Event had no physical or emotional affect-other than wonder.

At about 9:45pm I witnessed a satelite or the space station go by traveling west to east. This lasted for about 1 minute. Later at about 10pm I began to see a string of mtany lights traveling in a line from the NW to the SE. In very short order (20-30 seconds) I realized this is something unexplainable. It was like a long row of bright dots traveling in a row and reminded me of a long railroad train. I rushed in to wake my wife to have her see them but she had already gone to bed.

MUFON,2020-04-26 9:20PM,4/26/20,,Franklin,KY ,KENTUCKY,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Was out walking my dog traveling east to west and looking at the moon because it is an unusually clear night. I noticed what looked like a string of anywhere from 15-20 lights traveling in a straight line one behind the other at what seemed to be a very high altitude and at a very high rate of speed. As the line of objects continued SE they simply disappeared one at a time (from front of line to back of line) without any kind of spectacular effect. They simply vanished. I assume it is entirely possible that it was a disintegrating meteorite etc. but it appeared to me that the spacing of the objects alternated back and forth from closer to farther away and back again. Additionally each light was identical in size. It didn't appear that each object was traveling at the same rate of speed at various times. My father was military and I've always been intrigued by aviation and am very familiar with flight patterns typical aircraft behavior etc. I also studied aviation safety at the graduate level for 2 years. I've seen meteorites comets satellites and even watched the space shuttle travel overhead in it's orbit many years ago. I've never seen anything like this in my life and it affected me viscerally. I do not assume that this was a UFO but wanted to record what I saw in the event that others saw what I did or if there were any recorded unusual aerospace events that could be explained by this.

MUFON,2015-09-27 8:30PM,2/23/21,,Philadelphia,PA ,PENNSYLVANIA,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report I have been searching for an explanation to a strange light that appeared in our bedroom over 20 years ago and have exhausted all conventional explanations. I'll try to be as brief as possible without leaving out details. The incident was so out of the ordinary that it is burned into the memories of my husband and myself. I woke up one night to the sound of our dog growling. A white light roughly the diameter of a dinner plate was moving slowly and randomly across our ceiling much like a searchlight would. It was extremely bright I would say self illuminating and solid like a laser light (more so even) with no diffusion toward the outer edges. My first thought was headlights coming through the window but the blinds were closed and there was no shadow of the blinds across the light. Our dog who had always been oblivious to headlights flashing on the living room wall and loved playing flashlight tag growled the entire time. I watched it move like this for perhaps more than a minute then reached beneath the covers to shake my husband's arm (he could sleep through a bomb blast!) and he woke with a start mumbling ""What?"" The second he spoke the light shot across the ceiling and down the wall disappearing through the floor. I will note here the corner of the bed and the dresser were between the windows and the section of the wall the light went down further discounting the source coming from outside. ""What the hell was that?"" he said now fully awake. To this day we both regret not getting out of bed and heading downstairs to investigate but we were both so dumbstruck by what we had just witnessed. My apologies for the length of this account but I wanted to get all the facts in. I am grasping at straws now; I don't know if this is UFO related ghost related (they are the next ones I will check with) or what but I would just like to know if others have had this same experience. I'm not asking for an investigation especially considering the lapse of time involved but I would just like a simple ""Yes others have experienced this "" or ""No don't waste our time with weird lights in your bedroom "" if you can manage it.

As I was walking I noticed a strange light far out above the ocean. It seemed strange because of the extremely bright/vibrant color and because it didn't appear to be moving. As I was looking at it trying to figure out what it was it zoomed toward me at a very fast speed and stopped (hovering) about 100 yards from the beach. It spooked me so I took off to my car. As I drove home I noticed it seemed to be following me as I saw it at various points during the drive. Since then my life has been a horror show. There are several of these orbs that follow me wherever I go (I can only see them at night). They have been attacking me with some kind of beam of something that feels like very painful pins and needles and heat. It is really hurting me and wearing me down and I don't know what to do about it. If you all have any experience with this type of phenomenon I'm desperate for help.

MUFON,2020-12-12 5:30PM,1/5/21,,Point Reyes National Seashore,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report I am telling this story but my oldest daughter Shelbi was the witness. On a night in October I had asked Shelbi if she would go feed the animals in the barn when she got home. We have a small farm in rural Missouri and we have horses goats chickens and cats. She knows I like them all to be fed before dark but she got home later then normal and had to feed them in the dark anyway. I got home late and she didnt tell me about the accounts from the night before until the next morning. She said that as she entered the field she noticed the animals acting very strange. Normally the 2 horses will be very excited to be fed but their normal behavior is to be aggressive towards one another they sometimes try to chase each other off as if they want all the food for themselves and sometimes we have to be careful not to get in between the 2 of them. She said on this night they approached her and just seemed very spooked. Looking around and trying to be as close to her as they could. She said ""its like they were trying to get into my lap"" and then she said the cats were doing the same. They were right under her feet and wanting to be as close as possible to her. This is not normal behavior for the cats they do not get fed at the barn and usually will just mind their own business. She thought their behavior was strange and proceeded to enter the barn and begin to feed the goats. She then said she heard a strange noise coming from the outside. She said she couldnt explain it very well but sounded like a distressed animal or something. Not something she has ever heard before. After feeding she came outside to try and see what the noise could be and when she looked in the direction of the noise she seen a flashing light that appeared to be off the ground (actually above the gravel road) about 20 feet. Higher than a person carrying a flashlight. She watched in for a moment and then turned on her phone to record it. It started to move erratically it would flash in one spot and very quickly move to another and then right back where it started. She got very scared and you can hear her breathing is raised from the fear and she started to run towards the house. She said it was so scary that she actually had tears in her eyes. She said the cats ran with her. I have the video and I can send that on to you. One more thing when she told me about this I was talking to my neighbor about it. My neighbor told me that on the same night (about 1-2 hours later time stamp from the photo) Her game camera picked up a weird light. It snapped a picture of it and it appears to be a light moving at a fast pace past the camera. She also sent me that picture and I can send that too. We have had many strange things happen out here all of the things I have tried to reason through. 3 people in this house have seen strange lights and orbs similar to the one in the video we have. My son said the one he saw was orange and seemed to be coming for him when he ran to the house. Years ago we have one instance of what might be considered an animal mutilation. We found a dead deer down at the end of our driveway and the back of its neck was ripped open and it looked as if the blood was drained from it. I thought maybe we had a rogue mountain lion in the area although that would be a rare occurrence since it was so close to our house. They are not very common here in Missouri. I have the pictures of the deer somewhere but I will have to really dig for those. That's it I thought with the video we have it might be of interest to you.

MUFON,2021-01-02 6:11PM,1/3/21,,Spring,TX ,TEXAS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report My son Jeff is posting this on my behalf. The sighting occured around May 10th-15th in 2014. Upon reviewing the photos today (Dec 11 2020) we decided the images are truly intriguing - as we found much greater detail today when we looked at them on a large pad rather than on my small phone that night it happened. It was around 8pm or so on a warm night and I went out to my backyard as I often do for some fresh air. I immediately noticed strange lights above my garage and walked out a bit farther and looked to where they were SSE between the back of my garage and some trees on the right. There was a horizontal black bar with a blue red and white light (cannot recall the exact order). It didn't look like a helicopter or anything I'm used to seeing. It made no sound and did not move - just hovered where it was maybe 2000 feet or 3 miles away (I couldn't tell the distance). Then it changed shape the bar folded up on each side so that now there were two vertical bars with the lights. Struck by this I went inside to get my phone and use its camera to take photos (included with this filing). The photos show what it did next it turned into long vertical red bar then changed into a gold orb then a white orb and cycled through some colors again. No sound the whole time and it did not change location. After about 7 or 8 minutes with my camera it just seemed to take off vertically or disappeared (not really sure). The pictures which we reviewed again today show some kind of structure within the lights (a black object or objects when its within the white orb - an outline of a sphere(?) when the red is above and below it and a kind of texture when it's gold. In one image there is a shimmer of mostly purple (with some green) light that seems to come from it - I did not see this with my eyes but it showed up in the photographic image.

MUFON,2020-10-15 9:00PM,12/14/20,,Warrenton,MO ,MISSOURI,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report I was riding in the backseat of my buddy's car and we were headed to Treasure Island Casino just north of Red Wing MN. We were on Country Road 6 about one mile north of the County Road 6 and County Road 1 intersection. The road kind of winds its way up a hill and back down through a valley so it is difficult to maintain sight of these objects without stopping. I wish we would have stopped because it was unlike anything I've ever seen in the sky. I have in the past witnessed strange lights in the sky in and around this general area. I go to the casino often sometimes every night and these lights are not there all the time. This night was unique because I wasn't driving I was with two other people and there was approximately 10 lights as opposed to only one or two. The lights were slowly moving east northeasterly and reminded of the ""Phoenix Lights"" event from the 90's. New lights would suddenly pop into existence in between two of the already visible lights while others would suddenly disappear. I was lucky enough to see an airplane flying at the same time in the same part of the sky. I know it was an airplane because of the flashing lights that every commercial airplane has on it. The airplane was moving much much faster than these lights and was also much dimmer in comparison to these lights. I wish I had been driving because I would stopped and observed the lights for as long as they stayed in the sky. The only thing that I can think of that it could have been is a long line of airplanes lined up and ready to land at the Minneapolis airport. However the lights were not flashing like all other aircraft that I have seen. Also how were they popping in and out of existence? I hope the above paints a picture of what i experienced.

MUFON,2014-05-11 8:00PM,12/11/20,,Valley Village,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was driving on TX-31 heading toward Tyler TX and right as the sun started to set I saw strange lights passing across the sky. It happened several times - at first I thought it could be a spotlight but I've driven down this road many times and I've never seen this kind of light in the area (and it didn't realistically look like any spotlight I've ever seen). As the light kept passing across the sky I paid closer attention and it really seemed to appear and disappear at random. There was no fixed point. The light didn't start and stop in the same place every time. I looked as if a light appears and shines against the cloud cover and flies a fairly straight-line path from the naked eye. I watched this light appear in irregular intervals for approximately 10 minutes before I finally tried to catch it on camera. I have circled in red where to see the lights in the videos - any other lights seen are glares on my windshield. I consistently saw the lights for about 5 miles and once I turned onto S SE Loop 323 I didn't see it again. Approximately an hour and a half later I was with a friend and we both saw the lights again at the far end of S Broadway near the Cumberland Park shopping center. Neither of us have ever seen this kind of light in the Tyler area and it was unlike any light we have ever seen.

MUFON,1995-00-00 12:00AM,12/10/20,,Los banos,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was heading south on Highway 195 out of Spokane WA when I noticed two separate strange light formations to the east. They both had one large white light with a small red light underneath. They also each had another smaller white light about half the size of the main white light that was 30 degrees below. After a couple of minutes one of the objects circled to the northwest back towards Spokane and I lost sight of it. The second object surprised me by coming towards me and then seemingly locking into a path that kept it at a 10 o'clock high position out of my left window. I couldn't tell exactly how high it was but my guess was it was 5 000 to 10 000 feet above me. I was traveling at about 65 mph slowing down to 30 mph while going through small town traffic. Amazingly the object stayed right with me at the same speed and position for over 2 hours. It even seemed to wait for me while going through the small town of Colfax WA. When I reached Lewiston ID the object seemed to gain altitude but was still clearly visible as I drove through the edge of town and headed down Highway 95 towards Grangeville ID. About 6:15 am it started getting light and I was hoping that I could eventually see what shape the object was. But as I drove up the canyon south of Culdesac ID the object gained more altitude and drifted out of my line of sight just as it became almost light enough to see it. As an Air Force veteran I can say that I have never observed any aircraft behaving the way this object did and I have no idea why it tracked me for that length of time.

Shortly after I saw orange lights slowly moving behind trees off in the distance one street over. Not a car was in the woods area. I began to hear noises around me at this point I noticed a strange light dancing on top of my house a weird small dot of light kind of sparking in the air and a weird white energy twister thing just moving within several feet in front of me. I was hearing strange noises all around me. Cracks. movement rustling pops clicks etc. The video camera seems to get real static like after I point it at these strange things in my yard.

MUFON,2020-10-15 7:09PM,11/26/20,,Tyler,TX ,TEXAS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Around 4:36AM on 11/1 I had just woken up and stepped outside to enjoy my morning coffee and cigarette. I sat down on our patio and looked up and noticed a strange orange orb in the sky. My initial thought was strange lights for an airplane or type of aircraft but noticed there was no trajectory of this object. I then monitored the object to see if it had any trails as it could potentially be a meteorite but nothing. The object in the sky was a large orange orb too large to be a star which had a transparent blue-ish tint surrounding it. The object was hovering in the same location in the sky (North) over the Bay Area in California it was moving ever so slightly in what appeared to be left to right. The object was pulsating in color going from a darker orange to brighter and the pulsating reminded me of a fireball. From when I initially spotted the object it sat in the sky hovering and pulsating for about 50-60 seconds. After that time the size of the object got smaller and color started to dim and appeared to be going back into the night sky and then it disappeared out of sight. I was able to capture of a video of the encounter unfortunately on my ipad and not the greatest image quality. I did do some research after and the object I saw is identical to other encounters of orange glowing orbs in the sky in FL and CA over the past 6 months.

MUFON,2020-09-16 3:00AM,11/2/20,,RIVERVIEW,FL ,FLORIDA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Started out as bright beams of light shining through my bedroom window at night. The beams of light we’re moving back-and-forth I’m very bright on my wall. I looked out my bedroom window to see what it was and I saw a bright glowing orb of white lights in my woods and it was moving back-and-forth. Then it started turning on and off like it noticed me watching it. It would move back-and-forth it could flash really brightly could make a strobe light effect it did all kinds of weird things. I noticed two more of them three of them total in triangle shape. Over the next entire week I started going outside in my yard and looking out into the woods and in the field beside my house. Started seeing the same three orbs coming from the south east also saw bright glowing orange orbs coming up thru the woods. Strange lights would appear in the field. Usually three bright orbs in a triangle shape. I finally noticed when I was out one night that the three glowing orbs are actually coming from three other glowing orbs way up in the sky. They look like stars but they were moving and also in the shape of a triangle. And you can tell that the three orbs way up in the sky were all part of the same thing because they all moved together. you could see beams of light coming off of them like the orbs up in the sky were shining beams down closer to the ground creating the orbs that I see in the woods and field. And it seemed like the more I went out there looking for these things and trying to figure it out The more activity happened and got much more intense. The last night I went out looking for these things they started coming out from every direction I looked at. Like whatever was up in the sky could project the orbs anywhere it wanted.

MUFON,2020-11-01 4:36AM,11/1/20,,Oakland,CA ,CALIFORNIA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I was traveling east with my fiance on Bay Rd. in Hadley MA around 7:20 (right before Atkins) when I first noticed a single low bright color shifting object just above the tree line. I had seen lights exactly like this before several times all near or above water sources (see my previous post from January 2019 of seeing a diamond shaped craft hovering low over the Connecticut River while traveling home from work in Northampton/Holyoke on rt. 5). For this particular sighting initially I only saw 1 light. It was definitely not a plane helicopter or drone as the light pattern was a rapidly changing almost opal or diamond like random color pattern not a standard FAA color scheme or pattern that planes and helicopters have. I asked my fiance who was driving at the time if he saw it too and he confirmed that he did. It was not moving in the sky and remained stationary as we headed into Belchertown continuing on Bay Rd. and turned off on our street shortly before Bay Rd. merges onto rt 9. When we got to our home we could still clearly see the same light from our front yard. It had not moved. We went inside and about an hour later came out again and it was in the same spot. I noticed now that it looked like there was a small helicopter flying near it like it was observing the strange light from a close distance. It was a much smaller much dimmer flashing white light next to it. We watched this for another couple of minutes and the strange light began to go from bright almost sparkling like color shifts to pure blackout (this could have been due to some clouds). It appeared to be right over Quabbin reservoir near the Belchertown/Pelham line which is a few miles from our house. After watching it for a few more minutes it made a pretty sudden and small shift in direction looking like it was headed towards us (headed west) in the sky. We could tell it was moving towards us because it got slightly larger in size and brightness very fast. Once it appeared to have stopped moving we headed out back (traveling west) towards Bay Rd. to get some food on rt 9 when I looked up and saw that there were actually several of these lights lining what appeared to be the outline of the lower portion of the Quabbin reservoir along rt 9 heading into Ware. I counted about 4 or 5 that were low and close enough that I could see them clearly before we had to turn onto Bay Rd. and they would be completely behind us from the car. The lights seemed to be in a type of line or formation or like I said lining the reservoirs edge or at least the lower portion of the water from my vantage point. I had only seen these kinds of lights in a diamond shape per my previous sighting so to see them individually spread out like that was the only difference from my first sighting. The lights/crafts were far enough apart that it couldn't have been 1 craft but rather a series of possible sentinels or smaller crafts hovering over different points along the water. As we headed toward rt 9 via Bay Rd I noticed another single light like the ones we just saw but it was over the Northampton/Hatfield area. It was also pulsating at a fast rate several different brilliant colors and was also low in the sky. It was the same type of light/craft but by itself possibly over the Connecticut River. I am not sure why every time I see these lights they are hovering over or traveling along a river or other waterway but I can't deny what I saw. After seeing the same type of light multiple times this time having my fiance also see them and confirm what I was seeing/what I said I had seen before it made me feel like I wasn't crazy and legitimized my/our experience. We are moving to Belchertown shortly and even though this wasn't the first time I suspect it won't be the last time I see some unexplainable things in the night sky near Quabbin.

As we continued northbound we all noticed 4-6 strange lights in the sky straight ahead of us at about 340 degrees NW from our location and approximately 30 degrees off of the horizon. After I stopped the vehicle we noticed the stationary white colored lights were multiplying as other lights would join the hovering group in a linear type formation. Once there were approximately 8 lights in the sky they began to move like fireflies changing positions and then coming together in a tighter formation. It was at this point that one of the objects ""fell"" from the sky creating a commit type of effect. Upon seeing this I drove quickly around the corner of my property to observe the lights without obstruction. As we relocated the light vanished within seconds.

MUFON,2020-06-15 7:00PM,9/25/20,,West Columbia,SC ,SOUTH CAROLINA,USA,,,"Long Description of Sighting Report While swimming in lake at dusk I notice a bright star or airplane light very high in sky but then noticed it was moving. It wasn't in a straight line it moved straight then stopped and made short sharp horizontal and vertical turns. It also made some swirling or curving movements. I started to think I was causing the movement because I was floating on my back in the water so I got to a point where I could stand still and it was the object that was moving. It was very high in sky only other light was 1/2 moon and maybe a few other visible stars. There were people at the lake other than me but I didn't know them and they sounded drunk. While I watched it seemed to be a little harder to see if I looked away it took me a second to refocus on it because of that I stayed still and didn't want to turn away. A boat was approaching me at the boat launch and I apologized for being in the way. It was a couple and I felt I had to explain my odd behavior so I said to the woman ""I was watching a strange light moving up anddown sideways ect... the older woman didn't respond to what i said just looked around at the ""drinkers"" and said ""a lot of people here tonight."" Then i didn't go back to watching people were turning on car engines and lights to leave. The motion of this one light reminds me of a time when i was 12yrs old (59 now) at home night time around 10p Dec around Christmas- 2 balls of light appeared in my bedroom and moved in circular path almost playful with each other I didn't feel afraid (I was the only person home)... but I never forgot it and have shared my story with friends over the years... the house was in Preston Ct on Swanton Rd 06360.

I looked up to the sky and saw a series of 7 lights moving in unison in a straight line from northwest to southeast. The lights were grouped such that there was a single light in the lead followed by 3 sets of tandem lights all spacing appeared equal and remained equal as they traveled across the sky. As soon as I saw the strange lights I quickly ran back in the house and awoke my wife and had her come look. When we got back outside the lights were still moving in unison in the same direction and still equally spaced. At this time there appeared another light which seemed smaller in size but moving much faster it was traveling from southwest to northeast it seemed to be at a higher altitude and seemed to pass over the string of lights. My wife said grab your phone. I grabbed my phone and tried to record video but I don't think there was enough light. I would describe it like someone was pulling a string. My wife described it as like a train. So it was one light followed by a space then a pair of lights with a space in between the pair. Then an equal space and a second pair of lights with the same spacing followed by an equal space the a third pair of lights.

A cigar shaped object spiraling in on itself like a Mobius strip at the ends leading into blackness. The middle had what looked like a gray or black straight rectangular support. And outside of that on both sides it looked almost like a chamber with glowing greenish color. Almost liquid like in the way it moved. It had to have been over 500 feet away but moved insanely quick.

At 10:02 pm I looked out over the Gulf and there was a strange light. It was different than the thousands of stars we were looking at. It was lower than where the line of stars started so I just started watching it. I yelled to my boyfriend to look because I swore it was moving. He confirmed. It moved like a drone flying higher then dropping. It would fly to the east and then to the west. It appeared to be coming closer at a certain point but not close enough for a better visual. At times it flew higher than any drone I'm aware of can fly. It moved slow never really going fast like I would have thought. I could see planes flying but this did not move like them. It stayed for at least 2 hours until we couldn't stay awake any longer. I was sure to watch the time in fear we may end up missing hours if this thing wanted to take us. I awoke an hour later checked the time and noticed it was gone but all the stars were still there. The moon was not out that night we were the only ones camping in sight it was extremely dark out. The light was the brightest light in the sky and a slightly orangish color compared to the stars. We were convinced we witnessed a UFO that night to the point I was extremely scared and didn't want to sleep that night.

MUFON,2020-06-27 12:00AM,6/27/20,,Badlands National Park,SD ,SOUTH DAKOTA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report This report is a little different. I submitted a report MUFON case 102564 in 2019 regarding a specific incident. However after discussing with the investigator it was requested that I submit a more detailed report of incidents which occurred decades ago to now in Wisconsin California and Arkansas for perhaps an additional look into the past closed case. The initial case number was from 12/20/17 was 88977. The following is the content from the two previous reports. I grew up on a small rural farm in paris township kenosha wisconsin. i remember several things occurring from 1987 when we moved to the farm until the summer of 1994 when i left for college. these incidents cover that time period however i can’t recall exact dates. much of this i thought of as a dream until facebook came along and an old friends contacted me saying something like “hey do you remember…” face in the window: it was around new years and my parents were away from the house at a party. my brother was at a friends and i had a friend over to work on a 10-page government report due when we got back from winter break later that week. i’d guess the incident occurred at around 9:00 pm and probably between december 30 and january 1. i was likely a sophomore or junior in high school so it would have been either 1991-1993. there was a large front porch on the front of our house and due to it being winter we never used the front door because the front of the house faced fields and the wind would sweep snow drifts onto the porch. so we always used the side-door which led to the driveway. however if you stand on the porch near the front door there was a picture window looking into our dining room and at the end of the dining room was a large desk with a computer. my friend had just finished the paper. we both stood up at the same time and turned toward the window. staring at us from the window was a face. i recall it being whitish/grey and it seemed as if the skin was smooth like warm candlewax. it’s head was longer than a human and slightly more bulbous but not in an exaggerated way. its eyes were dark and maybe three or four times the size of a typical human. while the description sounds like a stereotypical “grey” alien it also seemed different. in fact different enough for me to think it was something else other than an et until recently. anyway it was staring and in the few seconds i saw it i remember feeling as if it wanted to hurt me was upset with me or needed to get to me and was upset it couldn’t. i didn’t hear anything and i remember thinking that those were feelings i felt deliberately from this creature. it wasn’t fear although i was terrified. about the same time that my friend and i dove to the floor i saw the creature turn it’s head and run toward the driveway. from my position he ran to the left. after about five minutes my friend and i had convinced ourselves that what we’d just seen was a neighbor messing around with some kind of a mask. however when i walked my friend out to his car we realized that there were no footprints in the snow – and there was snow everywhere from the porch to the driveway. i don’t recall ever seeing the creature again. in my early thirties facebook came around. by this time even though i vividly remembered that night i started to think it might have been a dream. one day i received a message from my friend after connecting on facebook. one of the first things he said to me was “hey do you remember that night at your house when we saw that thing?” lights at night: i think this incident occurred before i was in high school so it was probably between 1987-1990. our closest neighbors with kids lived ¼ mile down the road and one of the kids was camping with me and maybe my brother in our side yard which was about a half-acre piece of land behind our 3-car detached garage and then bordered on the side by two large grain bins at least twenty feet tall and an old barn. i woke up in the middle of the night because i saw a really bright light shining into our tent. at first i thought maybe a farmer had pulled up near the barn to turn around and had their bright lights shining on the tent. i wanted to see who it was so i crawled out of the tent and as soon as i was out of the tent the light was gone. it wasn’t like someone pulled away or even flipped the lights off. it just wasn’t there. so i got outside and walked onto the road and didn’t see any cars. it was really dark outside and i was heading back to the tent. but before i got to the tent i saw several bright spherical lights. if i had to estimate i’d say they were between a softball and bowling ball in size. there were several colors although right now i only recollect red and yellow. initially they were hovering above me and the tent about as high as the grain bins. then they began to move. sometimes they were in a circular pattern and then sometimes three would form a triangle maybe five to six feet long. i don’t recall how many lights there were but i want to say it was around five. so they would be in the triangle or circle formation and then suddenly break from each other and just move randomly all over the place always above me but in a lot of directions before going back to their pattern together. that’s all i remember and always thought it was a dream. it never occurred to me that the incident wasn’t a dream until again facebook when this kid contacted me and asked if i remember the night we were camping in my yard and saw those strange lights by the old barn and bins. i knew he’d had been camping with us but i don’t recall him seeing the lights with me which was especially haunting for me. time loss: my friend and i were hanging out at my house. it was about noon and we were talking about something and decided to go for a walk down the street. we would have said “up the hill and back.” there was a dip in the road and then the road went up a hill.” we would often walk it when we were bored or talking about something. this was probably the same time period as the lights between 1987 and 1990 and it was in the summer because i remember wearing a t-shirt. my dad asked us where we were going and i told him just up the hill and back. he said not to be gone for too long although i don’t remember why. he and i walked up the hill and back. it was at most 15 minutes. but when we got back my dad was furious and said he was about to call the police since we’d been gone so long. had he not looked so mad i would have thought he was joking. then he said my friend had to get home because either his grandma or mom was freaking out and kept calling. i used to wear a watch back then and looked at it. only about fifteen minutes passed so i was even more confused but when i got inside the house all the clocks were almost four hours later than my watch. i remember going up and down the hill countless times that summer with my friend trying to figure out what happened and neither of us could. thinking about it that was probably the summer of 1989 or 1990 because my friend and i stopped hanging out shortly after that. flashing lights: it was nighttime probably around 9:00 pm in the summer. i can’t recall which year but probably 1989-1993. i was with friends but i can’t recall who. what i do remember is looking off toward the north probably about 85 degrees off the horizon to directly above us and we could see flashing in the sky. they looked like exploding fireworks without noise and without the streaming. the lights were all white and only looked like a quick explosion. my friends and i ruled out fireworks because except for the visual explosion there was nothing similar. plus they were so high in the sky and they were about the size of the stars before the exploded and moved. we could actually see what looked like a star then it would explode but also seem to move to another area of the sky and explode again move to another area of the sky and explode again. they continued in these strange moving patterns for what seemed like forever but was probably only ten minutes. the next day i described it to my dad who said it must have been the aurora borealis which was sometimes viewable but nothing like this. since then i have searched online and haven’t been able to find anything like it. i only recall seeing this once. dreams: along with these incidents i also had a series of dreams which unto themselves i wouldn’t think were anything more than dreams. in fact until i started thinking about the old farm recently i still just thought they were dreams. however after listening to an audiobook on an alien abduction i thought i would at least mention them. for transparency i should say that as i kid i did believe in ufos and ets. i wasn’t obsessed but if i saw something on tv i’d watch it and occasionally look at the sky hoping to see something. i only remember fragments of the dreams. the thing that made these dreams different from other dreams is i always woke up somewhere outside my bed and often outside of our house. one example is a dream i had about a ufo that was on the ground in our driveway. it was more of a “pod” of some sort and saucer-shaped. it might have been only ten feet wide and i remember thinking that it was way too small for me or anything else to fit inside. it was probably only three to four feet at it longest from top to bottom. i remember a typical grey alien of some kind but i don’t remember our contact as much as i remember it being irritated with me for doing something. but i don’t know what. it wasn’t mad but more like a parent is irritated with a toddler. at some point the saucer was flying around and i was with it but then it was on the ground again and i was left on the ground. when the dream was over i woke up alone on our driveway in the middle of the night. another dream i recall was something about these hooded creatures and a tall uncloaked figure in my bedroom at night. i woke up because i was floating but unable to control anything. i could only see and hear. the sound i heard was a light droning or humming. my legs began moving through the bedroom wall that led to the back of our house and toward the farm fields. the next thing i recall is walking by myself in the middle of the night along a trail. our farm had our house behind that was a field and then a large garden the animals (pigs cows goats) the bee hives and then a large soybean field we rented to other farmers. i was toward the back end between the bee hives and the pigs. i only remember this because the pigs’ grunting seemed to wake me up while i was walking. i remember dreams of a figure in my bedroom doorway multiple times as well as the feeling of moving without seeing anything. other places i woke up were at the bottom of the stairs alongside the book case our front porch and several times outside – often behind the garage and near the grain bins where i had seen the colored orbs. Report 2: I live near plantation circle and got up to let the dog out around 11:11. the dog was barking to go out but when i got to the door she wouldnâ€™t leave. i noticed some lights in the farm field behind our house. at first i thought it was someone playing with their drone so out of curiosity i walked to the edge of the field to see who it was. it was dark of course but it was clear with a lot of stars out so i could see a bit. just above the tree line i saw three bright lights just sitting there about fifty feet across. the lights were in the shape of a triangle but i donâ€™t know if that was the objects shape as it appeared blurred or misty. i was still thinking this was drones of some kind but then at the same time they all began to move upward and i thought disappeared. though as i looked at the stars i swear i saw them stop around 30 000 feet - the height of a commercial airplane. then it was as if they were shooting stars and shot further south toward batesville. though they were so fast it was hard to discern. they always seemed to maintain the same shape as they moved. though when they were at their peak they looked more like one object. there is a small local airport base nearby and a bomber airbase about 90 miles south and close to little rock. bombers will occasionally come by along the same path on daytime training runs. though these lights produced no sound. in fact there was no sound at all from insects or birds. out here thatâ€™s odd.

MUFON,2020-06-21 9:50PM,6/22/20,,Miami,FL ,FLORIDA,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I’m a self employed music producer and product designer. I run my own business out of my apartment down the street from a small college campus. I’m often up working late hours sometimes till the early morning. I decided to go for a little walk down to that area (I think about 2-3 AM)... when I saw these two bright objects entering the open sky pretty much out for f nowhere. They (together) came from the south East briefly heading towards the north west... they then curved back towards the north East. They kept passing each other and switched sides from one another. The whole sighting lasted about six seconds or so. They traveled a very large distance in a very short amount of time. I’ve seen other strange lights in the sky since that night I’ve been hoping to see it again quite honestly. Last night I saw these shooting star like things that were so close it startled me. I wasn’t able to sleep the whole next day after seeing those two lights racing each other. It was unbelievable.

MUFON,2019-08-05 10:45PM,6/18/20,,Melbourne,AR ,ARKANSAS,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report Lights Sighted During an Evening Walk. My partner and I were walking around the edge of a prairie during the early evening. As we walked back towards my mother's house I saw an amber circular spot light against the soffit of the house. It was about the diameter of the soffit width (about 2 feet). I immediately thought my flashlight must be on or some hunters were pointing a light at the house but when I observed the surrounding area I could find no source and my flashlight wasn't on. When I looked back at the house the light was gone. We were about 75 feet west of the house. I mentioned to my partner that I had just seen a strange light and he told me he had seen different lights at about the same time. He saw an amber light in the woods to the east of the house on the prairie edge and a few seconds later a smaller white light in the woods closer to the house and in the same general area. My partner mentioned the amber light looked as if there were streaks of light coming out of it. We both walked to the edge of the yard and watched the prairie to the east for a few minutes. I then saw a bright white light with a bluish cast appear over some trees. It went out and then instantly appeared over the prairie about a hundred feet away and disappeared. My partner and I saw the lights separately. Neither one of us viewed the lights the other saw. The following evening at a similar time my partner saw 3-4 unmarked dark helicopters fly over the valley where the house sits.

MUFON,2020-06-07 3:20AM,6/14/20,,Midland,MI ,MICHIGAN,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report I have reported several incidents to local law enforcement even trying to show the officers multiple videos to no avail. I also sent video to the FAA and NSA (they protect privacy rights in the US) as well as the US Army Corps of Engineers (I live on Lake Hartwell near Hartwell Dam - part of the Savannah River Dept. of Energy facilities). I have seen a lot of strange lights over the water sometimes near the dam. I live on a large peninsula way out on the lake; very secluded. I have been experiencing these encounters/incidents going on 3 years and would greatly appreciate any feedback as these objects remain unidentified. I have included a video along with two still-frames from said video. The video is raw (no post-processing); the still-frames I sharpened up a bit (is that a robotic arm I set that red arrow at.!?) I'd be happy to share more of the footage I have as well the full-video of this encounter (I had to trim it in half to make it email friendly). TY for your time and efforts.

MUFON,2019-12-01 6:35PM,5/10/20,,Blanchardville,WI ,WISCONSIN,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report While letting the dog out for his nightly break I seen a large and strange light in the sky to the northwest I had never seen anything like it before and knew it was a UFO. I called into the home and the 2nd witness came out side with the phone used to take the pictures. We both went across the yard to get a unristricted view and took 2 pictures on a cell phone. The object we seen is not what we seen in the pictures. The object was watched for 10 minutes total and appeared to travel Northwest along a solid path away from us it began to become smaller in the sky as time ran by. The 2nd witness believes the object went up and down then left and right while following a path away from us. I will upload 2 pictures 1st picture is long and cigar shapped and not anything special to look at. 2nd picture is round and it appears to have 2 or more faces in it unlike anything I have ever seen or ever heard of. I not only believe it was unknown but I along with the 2nd witness remain completely baffled by our view of this object.

MUFON,2020-04-27 2:18AM,4/27/20,,holt,MI ,MICHIGAN,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report This event started around 8:20 when I noticed a strange light SW from my house looking towards Pacific/Mission Beach from Bay Park. As I watched a second light appeared and they were stationary for a few minutes. As time went by a few more would appear they go out then reappear until at one point I counted 7 in a row. I started take cell phone pictures and immediately started posting on Facebook as I’ve never seen anything like this before and wanted to alert others and see if anyone else had seen them. This whole event lasted until about 9:10 or so. While I was using my binoculars I steadied my self against my open sliding door jam to eliminate as much movement as possible. There appeared to be one light over a second light below it almost like they were connected like a C. I’ll include a picture I drew of it. I sent pictures to one of the local weather channel girls and never heard back. I never saw any reports of this on the news stations in San Diego. I did hear from Facebook Friends that they either saw it or had friends that saw it from Laguna down to Rosarito Mexico. It would be nice to find out what it was.

MUFON,2020-04-24 9:00PM,4/24/20,,Fond du lac,WI ,WISCONSIN,USA,,,Long Description of Sighting Report My wife and myself were surf fishing at Riomar Beach on the Treasure Coast around dusk. I noticed the two objects that were floating in place for awhile and brought it to my wife's attention. I thought maybe they were flares from some type of Navy training it is my guess they were 6 to 8 miles off shore. They were both the size of the setting dun which had already subsided below the waterline. They hovered in place for a good 10 to 12 minutes then one slowly started to acend upward and to the North East at a fairly high rate of speed as it was out of site in a matter of seconds. Less than a minute later the remaining one left at such a high rate of speed it left a light trail briefly and was completely gone in 2 to 3 seconds at most. I took pictures of them but the pictures were lost with the phone l used. But l have done some research on the strange lights in this area as these are not the only instances l have encountered here over the past 10 years. The Vero Beach lights or UFOs over Vero Beach on YouTube can give some insight into some of what we/l have seen. Hope this is helpful happy hunting.

I didn’t see anything.

Observing the strange light as I drove closer one point the bright light shrunk to what an average star looks like in the sky and remained that way for several seconds and then enlarged back to its original state. It did this twice. Approaching closer it was in the tree line. At this time it was suspended there while I was at a stop sign. Continuing to drive i noticed it then started to hoover slowly my way. At one point it was directly over my head and I looked straight at it seeing it clearly. It was a triangle shape with a blinking light on each corner. The lights were yellow red and blue. I couldn't believe it.. It was hooving super slow over my head! It followed me for about 5 minutes on back roads.
